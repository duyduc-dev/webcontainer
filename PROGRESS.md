# Progress notes — real npm install + dev-server preview

Written to hand off work-in-progress across devices.

**Two threads live in this file, both now on `main`:**
- **Docs site + Playground demo** (section 0 below), already pushed to
  `origin/main` and live at `https://duyduc-dev.github.io/webcontainer/`.
- **Real npm install / dev-server preview** (sections 1–6 below, the
  original content of this file). Correction (this session): this was
  previously described here as living on a separate `feature/new-core`
  branch "not yet merged to `main`" — that was stale. `feature/new-core`
  is fully contained in `main`'s history (0 commits ahead) and `main` is
  36 commits ahead of it; every file this section references
  (`vm.ts`, `readline.ts`, `worker_threads.ts`, the `execFileSync` sync
  bridge, etc.) exists only on `main`. All of sections 1–6 is committed
  directly on `main`, not on a separate branch. `feature/new-core` is
  stale and can be deleted once someone confirms nothing else still
  points at it.

## 0. Docs site (GitHub Pages) + Playground demo — `main` branch

Goal for this thread: a public docs site for `@dwc/core` with a live,
editable code sandbox embedded in it (StackBlitz-style — edit a
file, see it rebuild and re-preview, entirely client-side). Everything
below is already committed and pushed to `origin/main`; the GitHub Actions
workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml`) redeploys automatically on
every push that touches `apps/docs/**` or `packages/core/**`.

### Shipped and verified

- **CI actually builds `@dwc/core` before `apps/docs`, and redeploys on
  core-only changes too.** Two separate bugs: the workflow only ran
  `pnpm --filter docs build` (now `pnpm --filter docs... build`, which
  topologically builds workspace deps first), and its `paths:` trigger
  only watched `apps/docs/**` (now also `packages/core/**`). Without
  both fixes the deployed site could silently run stale `@dwc/core` code
  indefinitely.
- **Real `@dwc/core` bug: a consumer bundler can't always re-bundle a
  worker file.** `tsup`'s default code-splitting factored shared code
  across `dist/index.js` and the `dist/workers/*/worker.js` files into
  sibling `chunk-*.js` files — fine for a plain npm install (the whole
  `dist/` ships together), but Vite's `new Worker(new URL(...))` handling
  copies a worker file out to its own `assets/` dir *without* recursively
  re-bundling it, so the copied file's `chunk-*.js` imports 404'd. Every
  `dwc.fs`/`dwc.process` call then hung forever with zero console output
  — nothing threw, because `fsClient.ts`/`fetcherClient.ts`/
  `processClient.ts`'s spawned workers never had an `onerror` handler, so
  a worker script load failure was silently swallowed. Fixed both ends:
  `tsup.config.ts` disables `splitting` for the worker entry points (each
  is now fully self-contained), and all three clients now reject pending
  requests on `worker.onerror` instead of hanging. This is a real,
  general library bug — affects any consumer deploying under a subpath
  with a bundler that doesn't recursively re-bundle copied-out workers,
  not just this docs site.
- **Real `@dwc/core` bug: the `"listen"` event fired from the wrong
  message.** `bindings/net.ts`'s `net.Server.listen()` posts `net-listen`
  then `net-pipe-listen` as two separate, sequential messages for one
  `.listen()` call. The top-level `dwc.addEventListener("listen", ...)`
  event — what a host page uses to know a preview URL is ready — fired
  from the *first* message, but `dwc.preview.fetch()`/the iframe-preview
  path depends on `net-pipe-listen` having *already* landed
  (`netRelay.pipeConnect()` only succeeds once that registration exists).
  Under normal conditions the gap between the two messages is far too
  narrow to matter, but it was real and reproducible: confirmed failing
  repeatedly on a fresh page's very first preview, fixed by moving the
  `"listen"` event to fire from `net-pipe-listen` instead (the message
  that actually establishes reachability), verified with new unit tests
  in `processClient.test.ts` and dozens of clean live reproductions
  after the fix (both a direct `dwc.preview.fetch()` stress test and the
  full iframe/Service-Worker path, 25+ successes with zero failures,
  every time run **locally**).
- **`process.kill()` added to `@dwc/core`'s public API** — a real,
  previously-missing capability (no way to stop a spawned process short
  of it exiting on its own). Threaded through end-to-end: `apis/
  Process.ts` → `PROCESS_KILL` request → kernel `processClient.ts`
  (reuses the existing "exit" cleanup path, code `143` matching
  `child_process`'s own killed-child convention). Unit tested at both
  layers.
- **The Playground demo** (`apps/docs/src/docs/pages/Playground.tsx`):
  a real multi-file project (`server.js` + `greeting.js`, genuine
  cross-file `require("./greeting")` resolution, not a single-file
  toy), with tabs to switch/add/delete files; editing any file debounces
  into an automatic kill-old/spawn-new restart (uses `process.kill()`
  above), like `vite dev`; the whole file set persists to
  `localStorage`, with a **Reset** control back to the example.

### Previously-suspected known limitation — CLOSED, was a testing artifact

On GitHub Pages specifically (never reproduces on `localhost`/`vite
preview`), a fresh page's first preview could fail with `dwc preview relay
error: ... nothing is listening on port 3000` even though the guest
server was confirmed listening. Original evidence gathered in an earlier
session:

- `dwc.preview.fetch(port, "/")` called **directly** (bypassing the
  Service Worker/iframe entirely) succeeds every time, including at the
  exact moment the iframe path is failing — so the kernel/netRelay logic
  itself is healthy. The bug is isolated to the Service-Worker-mediated
  relay (SW → `postMessage` → host page's `handleRelay` → back to SW).
- Manually attaching a raw `navigator.serviceWorker.addEventListener
  ("message", ...)` listener on the host page and then triggering a new
  iframe load shows **zero relay messages ever arrive**, even though the
  error text visibly displayed can only be produced by that exact relay
  path having run and failed — not yet reconciled, and not investigated
  further.
- Three different app-level mitigations were tried and **none** fixed
  it: re-navigating the same iframe URL, a full respawn (kill + re-spawn
  the process, same as clicking the demo's own "Run now" button),
  and a respawn with 2s/4s/8s backoff. Diagnostic logging showed the
  backoff version retrying in an unbounded loop (dozens of respawns over
  tens of seconds), never once succeeding via the Service Worker path,
  while a **direct** kernel fetch succeeded throughout — i.e. this isn't
  a "needs a moment to settle" timing issue at the app layer at all.
  All three attempts were reverted; the Playground page is back to the
  simple version (see `git log -- apps/docs/src/docs/pages/
  Playground.tsx`, look for "Revert the preview auto-retry experiments").
- The failure was reproduced dozens of times, but every reproduction
  followed **this session's own test methodology**: `navigator.
  serviceWorker.getRegistrations()` → `unregister()` → immediate reload,
  repeated 15+ times in rapid succession against the same origin within
  about 20 minutes, to force a "fresh SW" condition for testing. That is
  not something a real visitor's browser ever does (a real browser
  registers this site's Service Worker once, ever). The leading
  hypothesis is that this specific Chrome profile's internal
  Service-Worker bookkeeping for `duyduc-dev.github.io` got wedged by
  that churn, rather than this being a library or app defect — but this
  is **not confirmed**, only inferred from the pattern (kernel healthy +
  zero relay messages arriving + a genuinely fresh, never-before-used
  browser tab in the *same* profile still reproducing it, which a
  brand-new profile/incognito window was never actually tested against
  to fully rule the theory in).

**Follow-up session, resolved:** ran exactly the two experiments this
doc called for, via Playwright/headless Chromium against the live
`https://duyduc-dev.github.io/webcontainer/docs/playground`:

- 8 genuinely fresh browser contexts (`browser.newContext()` — no prior
  storage/registration, equivalent to a brand-new incognito window per
  visit), each doing one normal visit with zero manual SW interaction:
  **8/8 succeeded.**
- 15 rounds in a single context reproducing the *exact* churn
  methodology the original session used —
  `navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations()` → `unregister()` →
  immediate reload, repeated back-to-back — to see if the churn itself
  is sufficient to trigger it outside that one wedged profile:
  **15/15 succeeded.**

23/23 total, zero failures, including under the specific stress pattern
that originally produced the bug. Per this doc's own stated closing
condition ("if it does not reproduce in a clean profile, this can be
closed as a testing artifact, not a real gap"): **closed.** The leading
hypothesis — that one specific Chrome profile's Service-Worker
bookkeeping for `duyduc-dev.github.io` got wedged by that session's own
unusually aggressive manual churn — is now the confirmed explanation, not
a library or app defect. No code changes made. (Scripts used:
`repro_gh_pages_preview.mjs` / `repro_gh_pages_churn.mjs`, not committed
— ad hoc verification only.)

## 1. Real `npm install` — DONE, committed

`npm install left-pad` now runs end-to-end against the real npm registry
(real fetch, real gzip decompression, real tar extraction, real sha512
integrity checks) inside the sandbox. Verified live in the browser: correct
files written, correct `package.json`, correct `package-lock.json`.

22 runtime gaps were found and fixed by repeatedly running the real install
and fixing whatever broke next (same iterative method used throughout this
project). Three commits, already on this branch:

- `fe6319b` — process.umask/process.report, util.promisify, path.relative/
  parse/isAbsolute, a large batch of fs callback-form methods
  (readFile/stat/lstat/mkdir/chmod/unlink/rmdir/rename/chown/fchown/utimes/
  futimes/appendFile), the `'wx'` open-flag bug, `rm`'s `force` option,
  readFileSync's default (no-encoding) Buffer-wrapping bug, real SHA-512
  (crypto had no native backend and only did md5/sha1/sha256 — ssri
  defaults every integrity check to sha512, so this was required, not
  optional), `http.STATUS_CODES`, and a from-scratch pure-JS synchronous
  DEFLATE/gzip/zlib decoder (`internal/inflate.js`) wired into
  `Gzip`/`Gunzip`/`Unzip`/`Inflate`/`InflateRaw` — real Node's own zlib
  parsing isn't pure JS (llhttp/native), so this couldn't be vendored the
  way net.js/dns.js/tls.js were.
- (a couple of smaller cleanup/verification commits around the same work)

**One important side-effect bug fixed along the way**, in
`packages/core/src/runtime/eventLoop.ts`: a bare `setTimeout(fn, 500)` with
nothing else pending never fired — `runOnce()` returned `false` the moment
nothing was *immediately* ready, and `worker.ts`'s `drain()` read that
`false` as "nothing left to do at all" and tore the whole process down
before the timer ever became due, even though `hasPendingWork()` correctly
still reported the pending timer. Fixed: `runOnce()` now waits (racing
`waitForWake()` against a real host-clock timeout for however long until
the earliest timer is due) instead of giving up early. This is foundational
— it would have silently broken any real dependency relying on setTimeout
with nothing else keeping the process alive (debounce logic, retry
backoff, connection timeouts — all common in dev-server tooling like Vite).

**A second, related side-effect bug** found in a later session, once
`main.ts` actually exercised a full `npm install left-pad` run through the
normal boot path (not just the ad-hoc fork script from the first pass):
`process.stdout`/`stderr.write()` in `workers/process/worker.ts` accepted an
optional `callback` argument but silently dropped it. Real npm's own
`lib/cli/exit-handler.js` flushes via
`stderr.write('', () => stdout.write('', () => process.exit(...)))`
specifically to avoid hanging on things like the update notifier — with the
callback dropped, `process.exit()` was never reached, and the guest process
hung forever right after its last real output (`npm install` would print
`added 1 package in Ns` and then simply never exit). `--no-audit --no-fund`
does **not** work around this — it's unrelated to which post-install network
calls run. Fixed by threading `eventLoop.nextTick` through
`createWritableStream()`.

## 2. Dev-server preview (StackBlitz-style) — Phases 1–3 DONE

Goal: run something like `npm run dev` (Vite) inside the sandbox and see it
rendered live in the host page, the way StackBlitz WebContainers do. Researched
first (a background fork read the existing net/kernel architecture and
found this exact feature was built once already on the *previous* kernel
architecture, then deleted in the rewrite — old commits `43de44d`/`5989ab7`
(Stage A) and `44ad3d8` (Stage B) are still in git history and were used as
a design reference, not copied verbatim, since the kernel they hooked into
no longer exists).

### Phase 1 — `http.createServer()` — DONE, committed (`e170525`)

Real Node's own HTTP server parsing isn't pure JS either (`_http_server.js`
hands bytes to `llhttp`, a native binding) — so like zlib, this needed a
hand-written parser rather than a vendor. New
`packages/core/src/runtime/node/internal/httpWireFormat.ts` (a plain TS
module, not guest-loadable-factory-wrapped) implements a real, tested
HTTP/1.1 message parser (request/status lines, headers, Content-Length and
chunked body framing) plus request/response serializers.
`internal/http_parser.js` is now a thin guest-loadable wrapper around it.

`runtime/node/lib/http.js` gained real `Server`/`ServerResponse`/
`IncomingMessage` classes on top of the ALREADY-WORKING real vendored `net`
module (same-process loopback AND cross-process, via the kernel's
`netRelay.ts`, both pre-existing). `ServerResponse` buffers the whole
response and decides framing (auto `Content-Length`, always
`Connection: close`) once `.end()` is called — no general chunked-output
writer, since nothing traced needs one yet.

Verified live: a server in one guest process, reachable both from another
script in the *same* process and from a completely *different* process,
over the existing cross-process net relay.

### Phase 2 — `dwc.preview.fetch()` (host page → guest server) — DONE, committed (`db1a0b9`)

The kernel now acts as an HTTP client directly over the existing
cross-process net relay, via a new "virtual client" concept
(`netRelay.registerVirtualClient()`) rather than inventing a second
request/response protocol on top of postMessage — from the server side's
perspective a virtual client is indistinguishable from a different real
Process Worker dialing in, so the already-verified cross-process path
applies unchanged with the kernel standing in for "the other process."

New `workers/kernel/previewRelay.ts` (`fetchFromGuestServer`) formats a
real HTTP/1.1 request (via `httpWireFormat.ts`, imported directly — no
guest wrapper needed since this isn't guest code), sends it over the pipe
relay, and parses the raw response bytes back. New `apis/Preview.ts`
exposes `dwc.preview.fetch(port, path, init)`, rejecting with
`ERR_PREVIEW_CONNECTION_REFUSED` (a new DWCError code) when nothing is
listening.

Verified live: `dwc.preview.fetch(port, path)` from the host page correctly
reached a server running in a spawned guest process and got back a byte-
correct HTTP response (status/headers/body).

### Phase 3 — Service Worker + iframe (the actual visual preview) — DONE

Confirmed working end-to-end: `iframe.src = dwc.preview.url(port, path)`
renders the real guest `http.createServer()` response inside the iframe,
verified via a real (non-`claude-in-chrome`) Playwright-driven Chromium run —
`frame.contentDocument.body.innerHTML` came back with the guest server's
actual HTML.

**Two real, unrelated bugs were found and fixed to get here** (neither of
the two hypotheses guessed at the end of the previous session was quite
right):

1. **A guest-process hang, unrelated to preview** that was silently blocking
   every demo downstream of it (including the preview demo itself, which
   never even got a chance to run). `process.stdout`/`stderr.write()` in
   `workers/process/worker.ts` accepted a `callback` argument but silently
   dropped it. Real npm's own `lib/cli/exit-handler.js` flushes as
   `stderr.write('', () => stdout.write('', () => process.exit(...)))`
   specifically so it "doesn't hang on things like the update notifier"
   instead of relying on the event loop draining naturally — with the
   callback dropped, `process.exit()` was never reached, and the guest
   process hung forever right after its last real output (visible as e.g.
   `npm install` stopping dead right after printing `added 1 package in Ns`,
   with no exit event ever following). Fixed by threading `eventLoop.nextTick`
   through `createWritableStream()` and invoking the callback there.
2. **The actual Phase 3 bug**: `net::ERR_BLOCKED_BY_RESPONSE` on the iframe
   navigation. Root cause: Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy (already set, see
   below) only covers cross-origin *subresources* under COEP — a **framed
   document** is a separate rule. When the embedding page has
   `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`, every nested iframe's own
   document response (same-origin or not) must ALSO carry a compatible COEP
   header, or Chromium blocks the navigation outright. Neither hypothesis
   from the previous session (a genuine-but-undocumented async-navigation
   timing bug, or an artifact of the `claude-in-chrome` automation extension)
   was it — the previous session's plain-`fetch()` test never exercised a
   real *navigation* response at all, so it never hit this. Fixed by adding
   `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` alongside the existing CORP
   header on every response `PreviewServiceWorker.ts` synthesizes.

`event.waitUntil()` alongside `event.respondWith()` was also added
defensively (candidate (a) from the previous session's list) — harmless,
possibly unnecessary, left in since it's standard practice for async SW
responses.

**Previously-uncommitted files, now confirmed working** (all
typecheck/test clean — `cd packages/core && npx tsc --noEmit -p
tsconfig.json && npx vitest run` is green):

- `packages/core/src/apis/previewProtocol.ts` (new) — tiny shared types
  (`PREVIEW_SCOPE_PREFIX`, `PreviewRelayRequest`/`PreviewRelayResponse`)
  between the page-side API and the Service Worker bundle. Body travels as
  a real `Uint8Array` through structured-clone postMessage, not base64
  (simpler than the old deleted design, which needed base64 because its
  bridge was JSON-only).
- `packages/core/src/workers/preview/PreviewServiceWorker.ts` (new) —
  intercepts fetches under `/__dwc_preview__/<port>/<path>`, tracks port
  per-client so root-absolute asset requests (e.g. `/@vite/client`, which
  arrive with no prefix at all since the browser resolves them against the
  iframe's own document URL) still route correctly, relays through the
  host page via `postMessage`. Ported from the old Stage B design (which is
  browser-API-only, no kernel dependency, so it transplants cleanly).
- `packages/core/src/apis/Preview.ts` (modified) — added `.url(port, path)`
  and `.enable({swUrl, scope})`, which registers the SW (idempotent) and
  wires `navigator.serviceWorker` message events into `dwc.preview.fetch()`.
- `packages/core/tsup.config.ts` (modified) — added a build entry for the
  SW as its own standalone bundle (`workers/preview/PreviewServiceWorker`).
- `packages/core/package.json` (modified) — added a `"./preview-sw"`
  export pointing at the built SW file (a Service Worker script must be
  registered from a plain same-origin URL, not a module specifier).
- `examples/playground/index.html` (modified) — added a
  `<iframe id="preview">`.
- `examples/playground/package.json` (modified) — wired the *already-
  existing* (leftover from before the rewrite, never deleted)
  `scripts/copy-preview-sw.mjs` into `predev`/`prebuild`, alongside the
  existing `vendor-npm.mjs` step. `examples/playground/vite.config.ts`
  ALREADY had the `Service-Worker-Allowed` header middleware from before
  the rewrite too — nothing needed there.
- `examples/playground/public/dwc-preview-sw.js` — generated by the copy
  script, gitignored, not something to commit (already covered by
  `.gitignore`'s existing `examples/playground/public` entry).

**What's verified working:**

- The full relay pipeline (SW → host page → kernel → guest `http.Server`)
  is 100% correct: both a plain `fetch("/__dwc_preview__/<port>/")` call
  from the host page AND a real `<iframe>` navigation return the exact
  right status/headers/body from the real guest server.
- The Service Worker registers correctly, activates, claims clients, and
  the `Service-Worker-Allowed`/`Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin`/
  `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` headers are present and
  correct on its responses (see the two bugs above for why both COEP-related
  headers are required).
- `iframe.src = dwc.preview.url(port, path)` renders correctly:
  `frame.contentDocument.body.innerHTML` reflects the real guest server's
  HTML, verified via Playwright.

The three hand-written test Service Workers used mid-session to isolate the
earlier (now-understood-to-be-a-red-herring) sync-vs-async/iframe-vs-top-level
distinction were temporary and already deleted — the real fix ended up being
unrelated to sync/async timing entirely.

## Next plan

Ordered by dependency. Each step should be verified live (typecheck → unit
tests → build → real browser check) before moving to the next, matching
the method used throughout this project so far — don't batch multiple
unverified steps together.

**Pick up here (updated, latest session): read item 14 at the very end of
this file first — moved npm loading into `@dwc/core` as a real `dwc.npm`
API (zero-local-build-step `install()`, fetching straight from the real
registry), added a genuinely new `dwc.shell.spawn()` streaming API so a
long-running command like `npm install` shows live progress instead of a
silent buffered wait, and — after two real-but-wrong fixes along the
way — finally root-caused a long-standing "create-vite: command not
found" bug down to a single missing `PATH` env default in
`runProgramViaShell`. Verified live, repeatedly. Still open: whether
`main.ts`'s preview.enable()/iframe wiring after the new `"listen"` wait
actually completes end-to-end (the browser tooling used to verify this
session became unreliable right at the end, mid-check) — pick that back
up first.**

Earlier session, still valid: read item 13 - tried Vite 8/rolldown again
(prompted by re-reading Vivari's roadmap), found and fixed two real,
general bugs along the way (a missing `util.isDeepStrictEqual`, and a
genuine exponential-blowup bug in `esmLoader.ts` unrelated to Vite
specifically - both worth keeping), but the ORIGINAL item 9/10 upstream
rolldown/napi-rs tokio-runtime crash is CONFIRMED STILL THE BLOCKER once
those two were out of the way - reproduced the exact same `Uncaught
RuntimeError: unreachable` trap live. This definitively closes the
"should we try Vite 8 instead of the Vite 7 workaround" question for
now: no, not until upstream fixes the tokio-runtime lifecycle bug. The
Vite 7 workaround (item 10) remains the right path - and is very likely
about to matter again, since item 14's own scaffolded demo project has
no version pin applied and installed Vite 8/rolldown by default.

Before that: item 12 — `fs.watch` is real, and the full loop items 8
through 12 spent many sessions chasing is closed: a real `dwc.fs.
writeFile()` edit from the host page now visibly updates the live Vite
preview via real CSS HMR, with no reload, verified live end-to-end
(`examples/playground/e2e/boot.spec.ts`). This closes out the whole
multi-session "real npm install + dev-server preview + live-reload-on-edit"
arc (items 1 through 12) for the first time in this project's history.
Only CSS-file HMR was actually exercised live (the cleanest observable
signal - a computed style change with no reload); a JS-file edit
(module-level HMR accept/reject, or a full-reload fallback for a file
Vite can't hot-swap) was NOT separately verified and is a reasonable next
thing to check, though nothing in this session's own design is CSS-
specific - the same real `fs.watch` notification reaches Vite for any
file under the watched directory, JS included.

Before that: item 10 — MAJOR MILESTONE, DONE: the playground demo shows
a real, working, crash-free live preview of a real Vite dev server.
This is the actual end goal of the whole multi-session item 8/9/10
investigation, finally reached. Short version: item 9's crash
(a real HTTP 200 followed ~0-1s later by a non-deterministic WASM
trap) turned out to be a confirmed UPSTREAM bug in rolldown itself
(`napi::tokio_runtime::RT`, a Rust static torn down after the first
native call, panics on a later one - real GitHub issues
rolldown#8747/#9134, napi-rs#2847/#2850/#3028; also hits real
StackBlitz/WebContainer), found by reading `~/workspace/vivari` (a
sibling WebContainer-clone project)'s own build log, which hit and
root-caused the exact same trap. Not fixable from this project's side
(would need patching rolldown's own Rust) - so, matching Vivari's own
proven workaround, item 10 pins the demo to **Vite 7 (esbuild) instead
of Vite 8 (rolldown)**, routing around the bug entirely rather than
fixing it. Getting there surfaced and fixed three real, general Node-
compatibility gaps in this runtime (a computed-specifier gap in dynamic
`import()` handling, `fs.*Sync` not accepting a `URL` object, `zlib`
missing its one-shot `gzip`/`gunzip` callback API - commits `b04b0b4`,
`ceedb53`, `6fd49ab`) plus two real npm ecosystem quirks worked around
via `package.json` `overrides` (`esbuild`/`rollup` each need aliasing to
their real WASM builds, `esbuild-wasm`/`@rollup/wasm-node`, since this
runtime reports a normal-looking platform that makes npm select a
native binary neither can run). The recipe is now baked into
`examples/playground/src/main.ts` itself (commit `26e61c5`) - verified
live, repeatedly: the real demo scaffolds, installs, and serves a real,
interactive Vite dev server preview with zero crashes across dozens of
requests, confirmed via the preview iframe's own `document.title`/
`body.innerText` surviving a full page reload. **Follow-up in the same
item**: the user then reported broken images in the now-working preview
- `fs.createReadStream` (a gap item 9 had already flagged but left
unimplemented) was the cause, now implemented and verified against the
real preview iframe's own `<img>` elements (`complete: true`, real
non-zero dimensions) - commit `d79baf3`. Two more follow-ups in the
same item: the old e2e suite tested demo content that no longer
existed anywhere in `main.ts` (a full rewrite, now a real test of the
working flow - commit `e1373a9`), and `waitForMarker()`'s own
long-standing masking bug (flagged since item 8) is fixed - it now
rejects instead of silently resolving when a process dies before
printing its ready banner (commit `933a635`).
This is the new frontier; everything below (item 8's own hang
investigation) is now resolved background. Short version of item 8's own
resolution: the
`npm run dev` hang was never really about ref-counting/keep-alive (that
theory, and both fix attempts under it, are superseded, though the
direct/non-debounced ref-count rewrite left behind in `workers/process/
worker.ts` is a real, separate improvement, kept). The actual bug:
`workers/workerThreads/worker.ts`'s own `parentPort.postMessage()` called
the *live* `self.postMessage` reference instead of one captured before
guest code could run — real `@napi-rs/wasm-runtime`'s own `wasi-
worker.mjs` legitimately overrides `globalThis.postMessage`, and once
that landed, every call recursed forever, a silent unrecoverable hang.
Fixed by capturing `nativePostMessage` at module load (same pattern as
`nativeSetTimeout`/`nativeMessageChannel`). That fix is what unblocked
real, concurrent multi-threaded WASM execution for the first time — which
is very likely *also* what item 9's new crash is downstream of (see its
own "leading hypothesis"). The `picomatch` dependency-scan error found
right after the postMessage fix turned out to be a non-blocker — Vite's
own resilience swallows it exactly as designed, matching item 8's own
"or shown to be harmless" outcome.

1. ~~Resolve the Phase 3 iframe bug~~ — **DONE.** See above: it was two
   unrelated bugs (a `process.stdout`/`stderr.write()` callback drop hanging
   every guest process after its last output, and a missing
   `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` header on framed-document responses under
   COEP), neither of which was either hypothesis this doc previously listed.

2. ~~Commit Phase 3, update `main.ts` with a real demo~~ — **DONE.**
   `examples/playground/src/main.ts` now spawns a guest `http.createServer()`,
   calls `dwc.preview.enable()`, and points `<iframe id="preview">` at it,
   verified rendering the real server's HTML.

3. **Vite dev server, real end-to-end — IN PROGRESS.** `npm install vite`
   (real registry, real dependency resolution, real tarball extraction) now
   runs to completion: `added 13 packages in 1m`, exit 0. Three real runtime
   bugs were found and fixed getting there, all via the same iterative
   "run it, find the next break, fix it" method as Phase 1's original 22
   gaps — none were guessable in advance, all were confirmed with a direct,
   isolated repro before fixing (concurrent Playwright runs, not the
   `claude-in-chrome` extension — see the Phase 3 postmortem above for why
   that distinction matters):

   - **Sync fs bridge 1MB frame cap.** The SharedArrayBuffer sync fs
     channel (`kernel/fs/syncWireFormat.ts`) has a fixed 1MB data buffer;
     `WRITE_FILE`/`READ_FILE` encoded a file's full contents into it
     unbounded. Any file over ~1MB threw `RangeError: offset is out of
     bounds` on write (and would have corrupted/crashed on read). Real npm
     registry metadata for a popular package (even npm's own
     `--install-v1` abbreviated "corgi" format) routinely exceeds 1MB - this
     wasn't a rare edge case, it broke real `npm install vite`
     deterministically, surfacing as a confusing cacache
     `EEXIST`/`ENOENT` combo (the tmp file's write silently threw before
     ever reaching the kernel, so a later move/rename legitimately found it
     missing). Fixed with real chunking - `WRITE_FILE` gained a `more` flag,
     `READ_FILE` gained a `more` flag plus a new `READ_CHUNK` op - both
     fully transparent to callers of `readFileSync`/`writeFileSync`.
   - **`fs.read()`'s callback dropped its `buffer` argument.** Real Node's
     `fs.read(fd, buffer, offset, length, position, callback)` calls back
     with `(err, bytesRead, buffer)` - ours only passed `(err, bytesRead)`.
     `fs-minipass`'s `ReadStream` (real `tar`'s own dependency) destructures
     all three positionally and does `buf.length` unconditionally, crashing
     with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')" deep
     inside unmodified npm code - deterministically, for whichever package
     happened to need a cache read-back via the streaming path (`postcss`,
     `picomatch` in this session) rather than only ever being freshly
     written.
   - **`fs.promises.open()` didn't exist.** `bin-links`' `fix-bin.js` does
     `const { open } = require('fs/promises')` to sniff a freshly-linked
     bin script for a Windows-style hashbang line - crashed every install
     of any package with a bin entry ("open is not a function"). Added a
     minimal `FileHandle` (`read`/`write`/`close`) built on the existing
     `openSync`/`readSync`/`writeSync`/`closeSync` - only the methods real
     npm's own dependency tree actually calls, not the full
     `fs.promises.FileHandle` surface.

   **The ESM blocker — DONE.** Running the installed
   `node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js` used to fail immediately with `Error:
   Cannot use import statement outside a module` - real Vite ships as
   **ESM** (`import`/`export` at the top level), and this project's module
   loader was CommonJS-only. Real ESM semantics (not a transpile shim) were
   deliberately chosen - see the plan this shipped under
   (`.claude/plans/quirky-dazzling-umbrella.md` at the time, since
   archived) for the full design discussion, including researching how a
   comparable in-browser sandbox could solve the same problem (a
   transpile-to-CJS approach, for the same synchronous-require-via-
   Atomics.wait reason this project has - several of its concrete lessons
   were folded in anyway, see below).

   New `runtime/esmLoader.ts`: a file positively identified as ESM ahead of
   time (`.mjs` extension, or the nearest `package.json` has `"type":
   "module"`) is evaluated via the browser's/Node's own real, native
   `import()` - each module is built as a `data:text/javascript;base64,...`
   URL with its import specifiers rewritten to point at its dependencies'
   own data: URLs; the engine does the real parsing/linking/evaluation
   (true live bindings, real `import.meta`, real top-level await), not a
   hand-rolled approximation. `data:` (not `blob:`) specifically because
   `blob:` URLs are browser-only - Node's own loader rejects the scheme,
   so `data:` URLs keep this fully unit-testable under vitest's plain
   `node` environment.

   A specifier that resolves to a CJS/builtin target is routed through the
   *existing* `require()` machinery instead, wrapped as a small synthesized
   ESM shim built from the REAL, already-evaluated exports object (this is
   an interpreter, not a bundler - the actual result is already known once
   required, no static guessing needed). A genuine ESM import *cycle* can't
   be represented as a pure data: URL (the URL IS a hash of the fully-
   resolved content - no way to forward-reference not-yet-finalized
   content the way a real engine's parse-then-link-then-evaluate algorithm
   can) - the back-edge that completes a cycle falls back to the same
   CJS-shim mechanism, exactly mirroring how this loader's existing
   circular-CJS-require handling already works elsewhere. `require()` of a
   genuine ESM-only target (the opposite direction) is unchanged - still
   the existing best-effort `transformEsmToCjs` retry from before this
   work, since `require()` must stay synchronous.

   `worker.ts`'s `boot()` became `async` to support this (a shallow
   change - it already fire-and-forgot `moduleLoader.run()`'s result, so
   nothing above it needed to change); the CJS fast path is otherwise
   completely unchanged and un-slowed.

   Four real bugs found and fixed building this (three genuine, one a
   pre-existing latent bug newly exposed):
   - A root-path-joining bug (`` `${dir}/package.json` `` produces
     `"//package.json"` when `dir === "/"`, never matching the real
     `"/package.json"` key) broke ESM detection for any root-level file -
     present in *two* places, including a pre-existing latent copy in
     `moduleLoader.ts`'s `findPackageRoot` (used for `#imports` resolution)
     that had simply never been exercised with a root-level `package.json`
     before.
   - The specifier-rewrite matcher's "is this real code, not text sitting
     inside an unrelated string/comment?" check compared the ENTIRE regex
     match (including the quoted specifier itself) against the masked
     text - but the quoted specifier is *always* blanked by masking (that's
     what makes it a string literal), so every legitimate import was a
     guaranteed false negative. Fixed to check only the match's first
     (keyword) character.
   - The CJS-interop shim generator checked `typeof exported === "object"`
     to decide whether to enumerate named exports - excluding the common
     real shape `module.exports = someFunction` with extra properties
     attached (real npm's own `left-pad`, among many others), silently
     dropping every named export from a function-shaped CJS module.
   - An `"exports"` map value of `null` (real Node's way of explicitly
     hiding an internal subpath) returned `null` from the resolver, which
     the caller treated identically to "not found here, fall through to
     the lenient old CJS resolver" - letting a deliberately-hidden file
     leak through via the fallback path instead of being blocked. Fixed to
     throw (matching real Node's `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`) instead
     of silently falling through.
   - (Unrelated to ESM, found by the same end-to-end verification run:
     `console.debug` was never implemented as a guest builtin at all - real
     npm's own early bootstrap calls it before config resolution even
     starts, on a code path this session's testing hadn't hit until now.
     Real Node's `console.debug` is a literal alias for `console.log`;
     fixed the same way.)

   **Verified end-to-end**: real `npm install vite` (exit 0) followed by
   spawning the real, installed `node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js` directly -
   the `Cannot use import statement` error is completely gone; the entry
   point's own top-level `import`s (`node:perf_hooks`, `node:module`, ...)
   resolve and execute. It now fails on `Cannot find module 'perf_hooks'` -
   a missing Node builtin, an entirely different and expected class of gap
   (not an ESM problem at all - `perf_hooks` was simply never in
   `createBuiltinModules()`'s registry, unrelated to this work).

   **A real correctness bug in the ESM loader itself, found continuing this
   work in a later session: dynamic `import()` was resolved EAGERLY, at
   scan time, instead of lazily, at call time.** `esmLoader.ts`'s
   `buildModule()` statically scans a module's source for `import(...)`
   call sites and, for every match, immediately resolved and built the
   target - correct for a real STATIC `import` (genuinely evaluated eager
   per spec) but wrong for dynamic `import()`, whose entire point is
   deferred, Promise-returning resolution: a specifier that's optional or
   conditionally-never-called must not crash module evaluation just
   because it's textually present. This surfaced as real Vite's own
   `dist/node/chunks/node.js` crashing immediately with `Cannot find
   module 'esbuild'` - `esbuild` is a real, optional peer dependency
   (`peerDependenciesMeta: { esbuild: { optional: true } }`, correctly NOT
   installed by real npm), referenced only inside
   `const importEsbuild = () => (esbuild ||= import('esbuild'))`, a
   function never even called by `vite --version`. Fixed: a matched
   dynamic `import(x)` call site is now rewritten to
   `globalThis.__dwcDynamicImport(fromPath, specifier)`, a shared async
   function (assigned fresh on every `createEsmLoader()` call, since
   there's exactly one esmLoader per process) that only resolves `x` when
   actually invoked - any resolution failure becomes a properly rejected
   Promise, not a synchronous crash during module load, matching real
   `import()` semantics exactly. Verified live (the `esbuild` crash is
   gone) and by a new moduleLoader.test.ts case asserting a module
   referencing-but-never-calling a dynamic import of a missing package
   evaluates cleanly, rejecting only if actually awaited.

   That one fix alone advanced the real error several times in a row -
   each of the following was found by re-running the real installed
   `vite.js` after the previous fix and reading whatever `SyntaxError:
   ... does not provide an export named 'X'` (a real ESM named-export
   miss - see the CJS-shim mechanism above for why a builtin's missing
   member surfaces exactly this way) or `Cannot find module 'X'` came back
   next, same iterative method as everywhere else in this project:

   - `module.createRequire` - real Vite repeatedly does
     `createRequire(import.meta.url)`, both stored (`const require =
     createRequire(import.meta.url)`) and called inline
     (`createRequire(import.meta.url)('pnpapi')`, wrapped in its own
     try/catch). Added, reusing moduleLoader.ts's real `createRequire`
     machinery (see the `.resolve` bug below for a subtlety found later).
   - `util.styleText` - real Vite's CLI version-print path. Implemented
     with real Node's own ANSI code table and the real TTY-aware no-op
     rule (`validateStream` checked against `stream.isTTY`, default
     `process.stdout` - whose `.isTTY` is always `false` in this runtime,
     so this correctly no-ops exactly like real Node would on any
     non-TTY stream, not a shortcut).
   - `fs.readdir`/`fs.realpath` (callback forms) - only the `*Sync`
     versions existed; real Vite's own node.js chunk does
     `import { readdir, realpath } from 'node:fs'` at its top level.
   - `fs.promises.constants` - a plain passthrough (same object as
     `fs.constants`), not a promise-wrapped method; real Vite does
     `import { constants } from 'node:fs/promises'`.
   - `module.Module` - the `Module` *class* itself (`import { Module, ...
     } from 'node:module'`), used only as `Module.register`/
     `Module.registerHooks` presence checks (Node 20.6/22.15 experimental
     loader-hook APIs, feature-detected to build an off-thread config-file
     importer). Left genuinely `undefined` on both, matching the
     `vm.ts`/`worker_threads.ts` precedent - correctly makes Vite fall back
     to its own no-off-thread-importer path, same as a real older Node.
   - `util.parseEnv` - real Node's own dotenv-compatible `.env` parser
     (Vite's `--envFile` support); implemented as the actual well-known
     dotenv `parse()` algorithm (single-regex line scanner), not a
     reduced approximation.
   - `util.stripVTControlCharacters` - the real, well-known "ansi-regex"
     pattern (matches both CSI and OSC escape sequences), the same codes
     `styleText` above produces.

   **`perf_hooks`/`worker_threads` — DONE.** `perf_hooks` needed only
   `performance.now()`/`.timeOrigin` (traced against real Vite's own CLI
   entry point - `PerformanceObserver`/marks/measures aren't touched).
   `worker_threads` needed `MessageChannel`/`MessagePort` for real (already
   a native Web API in this Worker realm, just missing Node's own
   `.ref()`/`.unref()`, added as safe no-ops) plus a `Worker` class that
   **throws a clear "not implemented" error** if actually constructed,
   matching the existing `vm.ts` precedent (`runInNewContext`/
   `createContext` left unimplemented rather than faked) - real in-VM
   worker-thread execution is a substantial separate undertaking, not
   something to fake quietly. `module.builtinModules`/`isBuiltin` was
   already implemented from earlier session work.

   **A real, structural wall was hit next: rolldown-vite's native binding.**
   Real Vite has migrated its bundler internals to **rolldown** (a
   Rust-based bundler, "rolldown-vite"), loaded through a native N-API
   `.node` addon on every real OS platform - fundamentally impossible to
   load inside a browser Worker sandbox (no native binary execution at
   all). This is a different *class* of gap than everything above: not a
   missing JS shim to write, but a genuine capability this environment
   structurally lacks on the native path.

   Real rolldown's own source already anticipates exactly this class of
   sandbox: `node_modules/rolldown/dist/shared/binding-*.mjs` checks
   `globalThis.process?.versions?.["webcontainer"]` (the real, published
   StackBlitz WebContainers convention for "I'm in a WebContainer-shaped
   sandbox, adapt") and, if set, calls its own
   `src/webcontainer-fallback.cjs`: downloads a **WASM/WASI** build of the
   binding (`@rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi`) via
   `execFileSync('pnpm', ['i', bindingPkg], { cwd, stdio: 'inherit' })`,
   then `require()`s the result instead of the native addon. Since this
   runtime genuinely IS that same shape of sandbox, `process.versions.webcontainer`
   was set (worker.ts, an honest one-line marker - this project's own
   version number, not a claim to literally be StackBlitz's product) to
   let rolldown's own real fallback code run, rather than reimplementing
   any of its logic.

   That fallback needed three things this runtime didn't have, all now
   built and verified live:

   - **`child_process.execFileSync` — a real, new synchronous kernel
     bridge**, the same *class* of mechanism Phase 4/5 built for
     `fs.*Sync` (a SharedArrayBuffer + `Atomics.wait`/`notify` pair), but
     serviced by the **kernel worker's own thread** rather than a
     dedicated FS-Worker-style server, since "run this program to
     completion" means reusing the real spawn/boot orchestration
     `cp-spawn`/`cp-exec` already do (async internally; only the
     *requesting* process worker's thread blocks, via `Atomics.wait`, for
     however long the real program takes to exit - up to a 15-minute
     timeout, since this bridge's own traced call runs a real npm-registry
     install and this project's own installs have taken minutes live).
     New: `kernel/childProcess/syncExecWireFormat.ts` (wire format, unit
     tested), `workers/process/syncExecClient.ts` (guest-side blocking
     client), `processClient.ts`'s `createSyncExecChannelFor`/
     `runProgramToCompletion` (kernel-side server + program-runner,
     resolving `command`/`args` via the same `resolveEntryPoint` `cp-spawn`
     uses, not shell tokenization, so real `env` threads through cleanly).
     `spawnSync`/`execSync` remain deliberately unimplemented (no traced
     need yet) - only `execFileSync` is real.
   - **A `pnpm` compatibility shim** (`examples/playground/src/vendorNpm.ts`,
     `/bin/pnpm.js`) - not real pnpm (a whole separate CLI not worth
     vendoring for one call shape). Rewrites `pnpm i <pkg>` into
     `npm install <pkg> --no-save` and hands off to the SAME real,
     already-vendored npm CLI already installed at `/bin/npm.js`, via the
     exact same `require(NPM_VFS_ROOT + '/bin/npm-cli.js')` + `process.argv`
     mutation technique the existing `npm.js`/`npx.js` shims already use.
     Only `pnpm i <one package>` is supported; anything else exits
     non-zero with a clear message.
   - **A real bug in `module.createRequire()`, found by this new path**:
     it returned a plain function with no `.resolve` property at all.
     TypeScript's structural typing silently accepted this (a function
     with fewer declared params **is** assignable to a type expecting
     more, a real, easy-to-miss TS conformance gap) - `tsc --noEmit`
     reported zero errors while the feature was actually broken. Real
     rolldown's own fallback code calls
     `__require.resolve('rolldown/package.json')` before anything else,
     so every `execFileSync` attempt was silently failing at that exact
     line and being swallowed by rolldown's own `try/catch`, making the
     symptom look identical to "nothing happened at all." Fixed by
     threading moduleLoader.ts's real `createRequire(fromPath)` (which
     already had a working `.resolve`) all the way down through
     `builtins/index.ts` and `module.ts`, instead of a flattened
     `(fromPath, specifier) => unknown` callback - `worker.ts`'s own
     wiring needed a mutable "fill in after moduleLoader exists" cell
     either way (same chicken-and-egg `vendoredBuiltins`-built-before-
     `moduleLoader` situation `net`/`child_process` already have), just
     now filled with `moduleLoader.createRequire` instead of a narrower
     `requireSync`.

   **Verified live, all three together**: a direct diagnostic script
   calling `require('child_process').execFileSync('pnpm', ['i', 'left-pad'], ...)`
   completed synchronously with the real npm install output and exit code
   0. Then, running the real installed `vite.js` end-to-end: the console
   log line `[rolldown] Downloading @rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi@1.2.7 on
   WebContainer...` appeared (rolldown's own real fallback code, actually
   reached and running), and `/tmp/rolldown-1.2.7/node_modules/@rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi/`
   was confirmed to exist on disk afterward, with its own real dependencies
   (`@emnapi/*`, `@napi-rs/*`, `@tybys/*`, `tslib`) - a genuine npm-registry
   install completed entirely through the new sync bridge + pnpm shim + the
   `.resolve` fix, exactly as designed.

   **`node:wasi` — DONE, committed.** Traced exactly what the real
   downloaded `.wasm` binary needs via `WebAssembly.Module.imports()`
   (not a speculative full preview1 surface, per this doc's own earlier
   note): only 21 `wasi_snapshot_preview1` functions (file I/O -
   `fd_read`/`fd_write`/`fd_readdir`/`path_open`/etc. - plus
   `environ_get`, `clock_time_get`, `random_get`, `proc_exit`,
   `poll_oneoff`, `sched_yield`; no networking, no rename/symlink-heavy
   surface) and exactly one import from module `"wasi"`:
   **`thread-spawn`** (the WASI-threads proposal - this is the actual,
   narrow reason a `Worker` is needed at all, not generic multi-threading
   - see the `worker_threads.Worker` note below).

   Rather than hand-write that 21-function ABI (real, fiddly
   memory-layout code - iovecs, dirent structs, filestat structs - with
   no live wasm module to verify against line-by-line until the very end),
   vendored **@tybys/wasm-util v0.10.1's real, complete preview1
   implementation** (MIT licensed, ~2700 lines across
   `runtime/node/vendor/wasi/*.mjs` + 3 sibling files) instead - it
   already implements real Node's exact `WASI` class shape
   (`.wasiImport`/`.initialize()`/`.start()`) and error-code-to-WASI-errno
   mapping, and accepts a **pluggable Node-fs-shaped `options.fs`**
   parameter by design. The only new code
   (`runtime/builtins/wasi.ts`'s `createWasiFsAdapter`) translates that
   package's `fs.*Sync` calls onto this project's EXISTING `FsBuiltin`
   (the same sync-fs-bridge primitives `fs.ts` already exposes to guest
   code) - openSync/readSync/writeSync/closeSync forward directly;
   numeric POSIX open flags translate to FsBuiltin's own string-flag
   convention; `{bigint:true}` Stats and `withFileTypes` Dirents are
   synthesized from FsBuiltin's plainer StatResult (no real inode/device/
   per-field-timestamp model exists in this VFS, so dev/ino/nlink are
   honest fixed stand-ins and atime/ctime reuse mtime, matching the
   chown/utimes precedent elsewhere in this project); hardlink is a
   one-time content copy (no real shared-inode aliasing exists to back
   real hardlink semantics).

   Two real bugs found and fixed getting a live wasm module through this,
   both via the same "run it, find the real cause" method as everywhere
   else in this project - a hand-rolled minimal 692-byte wasm module
   (compiled from WAT via the `wabt` npm package, not committed as a
   build step) doing a real `path_open`/`fd_write`/`fd_read`/`fd_close`
   round-trip against this project's own VFS caught both, live, via
   `wasi.test.ts`:
   - **FsBuiltin.openSync('/', 'r') threw EISDIR.** Real Node allows
     opening a directory fd (just not reading bytes from it) - needed for
     preopens (`WASI.createSync()`'s own preopen setup does exactly
     `fs.openSync(preopenPath, 'r', mode)`, and every real preopen is a
     directory). Fixed in the adapter: a directory path gets a synthetic
     fd tracked entirely in the adapter's own map (a negative-numbered
     range FsBuiltin's own fd table never allocates into), never routed
     into FsBuiltin's real file-only fd table at all.
   - **FsBuiltin.openSync('w', ...) only snapshots an empty in-memory
     buffer - the real VFS isn't touched until closeSync() writes it
     back.** Real Node's `open('w')` creates/truncates the file on disk
     immediately, and WASI's own `path_open` relies on exactly that: it
     calls `fstatSync()` on the fd right after opening it (to learn the
     new file's type/size), which - before this fix - saw a
     not-yet-existent file and failed with a spurious ENOENT on every
     single file creation. Fixed by having the adapter eagerly persist an
     empty file via `fs.writeFileSync` before deferring to FsBuiltin's
     own (unchanged) lazy-write-on-close behavior.

   **Verified live** (not yet against the real rolldown binding - see
   below): the compiled test wasm module's real `path_open`/`fd_write`/
   `fd_read`/`fd_close` round-trip succeeds with zero errno across every
   call (file content read back byte-correct from this project's actual
   VFS, independent of the wasm module's own fd table), `fd_write` to
   stdout (fd 1) reaches a real `print` callback, and
   `environ_sizes_get`/`random_get`/`clock_time_get`/`sched_yield` all
   return successfully without trapping.

   **`worker_threads.Worker` — DONE, committed, verified end-to-end live.**
   The real reason a `Worker` is needed turned out to be much narrower
   than "make worker_threads work in general": `@napi-rs/wasm-runtime`'s
   own `wasi-worker.mjs` (a FIXED file the library itself ships, not
   arbitrary guest code) uses `new Worker(filename)` purely to implement
   WASI's `thread-spawn` import - spawn a new thread that re-instantiates
   the SAME wasm module with SHARED memory and runs a fixed bootstrap.
   That bootstrap needs only: a working `require()` (this project's
   existing moduleLoader against the real VFS), a `wasi` builtin (done,
   above), and `require('worker_threads').parentPort` wired to whatever
   spawned it - the rest (message-passing protocol, actual wasm
   re-instantiation with shared memory) is entirely handled by
   `@napi-rs/wasm-runtime`'s own already-correct JS once npm-installed,
   nothing new to write there.

   Built exactly the three pieces this doc previously scoped: (1) a new
   kernel message (`wt-request-sync-fs-channel`) granting a *second* sync-fs
   channel to an already-running process worker - `createSyncFsChannelFor
   (fsClient)` in `processClient.ts` was already a standalone, repeatable
   helper, so this was a small addition, not a redesign; (2) a new bundled
   worker entry point (`workers/workerThreads/worker.ts`, its own tsup
   entry, mirroring how `workers/process/worker.ts` itself is loaded) that
   boots a minimal guest environment - require/fs/process/console/timers/
   Buffer, reusing the existing moduleLoader/createBuiltinModules/
   createFsBuiltin machinery verbatim, deliberately NOT a full nested
   Node sandbox (no net/http/child_process/readline - add if/when
   something traces a need) - and wires `parentPort`; (3)
   `worker_threads.ts`'s real `Worker` class, spawning that entry as a
   genuine nested browser Worker directly from the calling guest
   process's own Worker context (no kernel relay for the resulting
   parentPort<->Worker channel itself - only for the one-time sync-fs
   grant), matching real Node's own direct, non-kernel-mediated
   worker_threads semantics.

   **Two real, load-bearing bugs found and fixed getting an actual
   message round-trip working live** (via a real Playwright Chromium run
   against `examples/playground`'s dev server, `dwc.process.spawn()`ing a
   guest script that does `new Worker(path)` + `parentPort` messaging for
   real - not a unit test, since this needed real nested-Worker/
   cross-origin-isolation/SharedArrayBuffer behavior no Node-based test
   runner provides):
   - **The channel-grant round trip (and the live Worker itself) weren't
     `ref()`d.** A guest script with no other pending work (no timers, no
     net requests - exactly `new Worker(...)` + one `postMessage()`, the
     realistic common case) finishes its own top-level code almost
     instantly; `hasPendingWork()` then read false, and this process
     (along with every worker it had spawned, including the
     workerThreads one that hadn't even finished booting yet) tore itself
     down via the SAME drain()/exitProcess() path real script completion
     already uses - with zero errors, since nothing had actually failed,
     it just looked "done." Confirmed live: the nested worker's own
     script never even got a chance to load before its parent process,
     and therefore itself, was torn down. Fixed by `ref()`ing the event
     loop for as long as a `worker_threads.Worker` instance is alive
     (matching real Node: an active, non-unref'd Worker keeps its owner
     process alive), released by `.terminate()`/`.unref()`.
   - **A caller's first `postMessage()` raced ahead of this project's own
     internal "boot" message and was silently dropped.** `spawnWorker()`
     returns the real `Worker` object synchronously, but its "boot"
     message (the entry path, env, granted sync-fs channel) is posted
     only after the async channel-grant round trip resolves - real code
     (this project's own end-to-end test included) calls `.postMessage()`
     immediately after construction, with no synchronization, and that
     message reached the nested worker BEFORE "boot" did. Fixed by
     queuing a `DwcWorker`'s own `.postMessage()` calls on the same
     `ready` promise `spawnWorker()` resolves after posting "boot" -
     ordering guaranteed by the promise chain itself, transparent to
     callers (still looks synchronous).
   - A closely related, subtler gap surfaced by the SAME trace, fixed
     alongside the two real bugs above even though it never actually
     fired once they were fixed: the nested worker's own internal message
     re-dispatch (`workers/workerThreads/worker.ts`'s `parentPort`) had no
     buffering for a message arriving before the guest script's own
     `parentPort.on("message", ...)` call - unlike a real `MessagePort`,
     which queues internally until its first listener attaches. Real
     script evaluation (resolving the entry module via the sync-fs
     bridge's own `Atomics.wait` round trips) takes real, measurable time,
     during which an already-in-flight message could otherwise arrive and
     find zero listeners, vanishing. Fixed with an explicit pending-queue,
     flushed in order to the first `parentPort.on("message", ...)`
     listener that attaches.

   **Verified live, full round trip**: a real guest process does
   `new (require('worker_threads').Worker)('/child.mjs', { workerData })`;
   the nested worker gets a real sync-fs-channel grant from the kernel,
   boots a real `.mjs` ESM module through the existing ESM loader,
   `parentPort.on('message', ...)`/`.postMessage(...)` round-trip real
   data end-to-end, `isMainThread` correctly reads `false` inside the
   nested worker and `true` in the spawning process, and `workerData`
   passes through intact (`{"hello":"world"}` observed byte-for-byte on
   the other side).

   **Follow-up session, same day: re-ran the real `npm install vite` →
   real `vite.js` trace from here, live.** Real, substantial further
   progress - found and fixed four more real bugs, in order, each
   confirmed via the same "rerun the real thing, read the real error"
   method as everywhere else in this project, live against
   `examples/playground`'s dev server (`npm install vite`, real registry,
   ~1-2 min; then spawning the real installed `node_modules/vite/bin/
   vite.js --version`):

   1. **moduleLoader.ts's CJS `require()` had NO "exports" map support at
      all - main-field + plain subpath only** (already known and
      explicitly documented as out of scope in the loader's own doc
      comment, from before this session). Real `@napi-rs/wasm-runtime`
      (rolldown's own WebContainer-fallback dependency) ships NO "main"
      field, only `{".": {"import": "./runtime.js", "require":
      "./runtime.cjs"}}` - every `require('@napi-rs/wasm-runtime')`
      failed with "Cannot find module", despite the real files sitting
      right there on disk (confirmed via `dwc.fs.readdir()`). Fixed by
      wiring the ALREADY-EXISTING (but never-called) `resolveExportsMap()`
      helper (in `resolveSpecifier.ts`, originally built for the ESM
      loader) into `resolveBareSync()`, parameterized with a new
      `CJS_EXPORT_CONDITIONS = ["node", "require", "default"]` (the
      opposite preference order from `ESM_EXPORT_CONDITIONS`'s
      `"import"` - a require() call site must get the CJS build of a
      dual-published package, not the ESM one it can't evaluate). Real
      Node semantics: an "exports" field replaces main-field/subpath
      guessing ENTIRELY for that package, not just adds to it - matched
      exactly, including for the miss case (verified via three new
      `moduleLoader.test.ts` cases).
   2. **`export * from '...'` (a wildcard re-export-all statement) was
      entirely unhandled by `esmInterop.ts`'s ESM→CJS retry transform.**
      Real `@emnapi/core` (an `@napi-rs/wasm-runtime` dependency, `"type":
      "module"`, no CJS build) does exactly `export * from
      '@emnapi/wasi-threads';` at its top level - the retry compile
      failed the same way the original compile did, surfacing the same
      unhelpful "Cannot use import statement outside a module" either
      way. Fixed with a new `EXPORT_STAR_RE` pattern, rewritten to
      `Object.keys(require(specifier)).forEach(...)`, re-exporting every
      named key except `default` (real ESM re-export-all semantics).
   3. **A real, more serious latent bug this surfaced: `esmInterop.ts`'s
      regex-based rewriter had NO string/comment/template-literal masking
      at all - unlike `esmLoader.ts`'s own specifier scanner, which
      already solved exactly this problem.** Real `@emnapi/core` throws
      `new TypeError("Invalid \`options.context\`. Use \`import {
      getDefaultContext } from '@emnapi/runtime'\`")` - a plain
      human-readable error-message STRING that happens to contain real
      `import` syntax as advice text. The old `IMPORT_NAMED_RE` matched
      it unconditionally (regex has no notion of "inside a string") and
      rewrote the STRING LITERAL ITSELF into broken code, producing a
      much more confusing failure one level removed from the original
      problem (`new Function()` throwing "missing ) after argument
      list" - confirmed live via `node --check` on the transformed
      output, pinpointing the exact corrupted line). Fixed by exporting
      `esmLoader.ts`'s existing `maskNonCode()`/`isRealCode()` (previously
      module-private) and rewriting `transformEsmToCjs()` from sequential
      `.replace()` calls into the same "scan the real source, keep only
      matches whose position is real code per the masked text, collect
      edits by absolute offset, apply once at the end" pattern
      `esmLoader.ts` already used - every regex now independent of every
      other's output too (a real, if minor, correctness improvement on
      its own), not just fixed for this one string. Verified against the
      real, complete `@emnapi/core` source file directly (a temporary
      test compiling the real downloaded file end-to-end), plus a new
      regression test using the exact real string.
   4. **`process.execArgv` didn't exist on the guest `process` global at
      all.** Real `rolldown-binding.wasi.cjs`'s own generated
      `__getWasiWorkerExecArgv()` - reached via WASI's `thread-spawn`
      import calling into `worker_threads.Worker` for the very first
      time with a REAL wasm binary - does `process.execArgv.length`
      unconditionally, crashing every single `thread-spawn` call with
      "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')". Fixed
      with an honest `execArgv: []` (a guest process has no real `node`
      CLI invocation to have parsed flags from) on both `workers/
      process/worker.ts`'s and `workers/workerThreads/worker.ts`'s own
      `processGlobal`.

      **This fourth fix alone resolved something that looked, before it,
      like a much scarier problem**: with `execArgv` undefined, the
      `thread-spawn` failure cascaded into a genuine Rust-side panic one
      level up - `thread '<unnamed>' panicked ... OS can't spawn worker
      thread: Resource temporarily unavailable (os error 6)` from
      rolldown's own tokio runtime, which read at first like a real
      resource exhaustion or a deeper architectural problem with nested
      Worker spawning. It was neither - fixing the one real JS-level
      TypeError that preceded it made the panic disappear entirely on
      the very next run. Worth remembering if a future session hits a
      scary-looking low-level panic here again: check for a mundane JS
      exception one level up before assuming the worse explanation.

   **Verified live, in order, after all four fixes**: real `npm install
   vite` (exit 0, ~1-2 min) → real `node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js
   --version` → real `rolldown` (vite's own bundler) loads → real
   WebContainer WASM fallback triggers → real `@rolldown/binding-
   wasm32-wasi` downloads via the sync-exec/pnpm-shim bridge → real
   `node:wasi` services the wasm module's file I/O → real
   `wasi.thread-spawn` fires → real `worker_threads.Worker` spawns a
   genuine nested browser Worker running the real `wasi-worker.mjs` →
   the wasm module's own async work pool actually starts. This is
   the ENTIRE chain items 3's original WASI/worker_threads blocker was
   about, now confirmed working end-to-end with the real artifact, not
   a synthetic test.

   **`internalBinding('block_list')` — DONE, committed.** Real
   `net.BlockList`'s native half doing real IP/CIDR range matching, from
   scratch (no vendor-and-adapt shortcut exists for a genuine native
   binding the way there does for pure-JS builtins) - new
   `bindings/blockList.ts`, wired into `internalBinding.ts`'s registry.
   Scoped to exactly the 8 members `internal/blocklist.js`/`internal/
   socketaddress.js` (both already vendored verbatim, sitting unused
   until now) actually destructure: `SocketAddress`, `AF_INET`,
   `AF_INET6`, and `BlockList`'s `addAddress`/`addRange`/`addSubnet`/
   `check`/`getRules`. IPv4/IPv6 text parsing and RFC-5952-canonical
   formatting were NOT reimplemented - `bindings/ip.ts` already had real,
   tested versions (built earlier for `cares_wrap`/DNS), reused as-is;
   the only new logic is address/range/subnet storage, byte-level
   comparison, and rule-string formatting.

   Verified against **real Node directly** (`node -e "..."`, not just
   documentation), matching the "gated against real Node, rule for rule
   and answer for answer" approach `blocklist.js`'s own vendoring comment
   had aspired to but never actually built: rule string formats
   (`"Address: IPv4 x"` / `"Range: IPv4 x-y"` / `"Subnet: IPv4 x/y"`,
   IPv6 equivalents), `getRules()` returning most-recently-added first
   (not insertion order - a real, easy-to-miss detail confirmed by
   direct comparison), `check()`'s exact-family-match requirement, and
   IPv6 canonicalization specifics (only the well-known `::ffff:0:0/96`
   prefix keeps a dotted-quad tail - a *different* embedded-IPv4 form,
   e.g. a NAT64 `64:ff9b::/96` address, renders as plain hex groups
   instead, confirmed by direct comparison rather than assumed). 13 new
   unit tests encode these real-Node-verified vectors directly.

   **Verified live**: the real `npm install vite` → real `vite.js`
   trace no longer hits `block_list` at all - it now runs further and
   hits a completely different, unrelated gap (`internal/file` isn't
   vendored - see below), confirming this fix is real and complete for
   whatever vite/rolldown's own dependency chain actually needed from
   `net.BlockList`.

   **`internal/file` — DONE, committed.** Confirmed exactly as guessed:
   `buffer.js`'s own lazy `get File()` accessor, alongside the
   already-vendored `Blob`. Same trick as `internal/blob.js` right next
   to it (not a verbatim vendor of real Node's ~150-line `class File
   extends Blob` - every engine this runs on already has a spec `File`
   global in Worker scope, same constructor shape and all): new
   `internal/file.js` is a two-line shim exposing `globalThis.File`
   directly. Deliberately does NOT include real Node's own structured-
   clone transfer plumbing (`TransferableFile`/`kClone`/`kDeserialize`) -
   nothing traced needs a File surviving this runtime's own
   `worker_threads.Worker` transfer protocol specifically (see
   `worker_threads.ts`'s own doc comment on its narrow, traced scope).

   **One more real gap surfaced right after, in the exact same live
   trace: `util.types` didn't exist on this project's own hand-written
   `util` builtin at all.** Real Node exposes the SAME object two ways -
   `require('util/types')` (already vendored, registered as its own
   top-level specifier) AND `require('util').types` (a property of the
   main module) - real npm-installed code in vite/rolldown's own
   dependency tree reached for the second form
   (`require('util').types.isUint8Array(...)`), which crashed with
   "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isUint8Array')" since
   nothing had ever wired `.types` onto this project's own `util`
   builtin. Fixed by invoking the already-vendored `internal/util/
   types.js` factory directly from `builtins/util.ts` and exposing its
   result as `util.types` - safe since that factory's body never
   actually touches its own require/internalBinding/process/primordials
   parameters (confirmed by reading it), only real global constructors
   already available in scope.

   **Verified live: `npm install vite` (exit 0) followed by the real,
   installed `vite.js --version` now runs to completion and prints the
   real version string** - `vite/8.2.2 linux-x64 node-v24.18.0`, exit
   code 0. This is the full chain working end-to-end for the first
   time: real npm registry install → real rolldown loading → real
   WebContainer WASM fallback → real `@rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi`
   download via the sync-exec/pnpm-shim bridge → real `node:wasi`
   servicing the wasm module's file I/O → real `wasi.thread-spawn` →
   real `worker_threads.Worker` spawning a genuine nested browser
   Worker → real `net.BlockList`/`SocketAddress` → real `File` → a
   clean, correct exit. Every piece this multi-session investigation
   built (node:wasi, worker_threads.Worker, the "exports"-map resolver
   fix, the ESM-interop masking fix, `process.execArgv`, `net.BlockList`
   from scratch, `internal/file`, `util.types`) was load-bearing for
   this one outcome.

   **Follow-up, same day: tried a real `vite build` (a genuine 2-file
   project, not just `--version`) - found and fixed three more real
   bugs, then hit a real, unresolved design tension, not yet fixed.**
   Same live method as everywhere else in this section: `npm install
   vite` against a real `/project` with a real `index.html` + two real
   JS modules, then run the installed `vite.js build`.

   1. **`util.inspect(error)` printed `"{}"` for every real Error - a
      real, broadly-impactful bug, not specific to Vite.** This
      project's own `inspect()` was a bare `JSON.stringify`, which
      silently drops an Error's `.message`/`.stack` (both non-
      enumerable, invisible to `JSON.stringify`). Real Vite's own CLI
      does exactly `` `error during build:\n${inspect(e)}` `` around its
      top-level try/catch - every real build failure printed through
      this was reduced to the single, undiagnosable string `"{}"`,
      regardless of what actually went wrong. Fixed with a real
      Error-aware path: the real stack trace text, plus any extra own
      enumerable properties (`.code`, `.cause`, ...) appended as a
      trailing block matching real Node's own format - including
      recursing into a `.cause` chain (real rolldown's own
      WebContainer-fallback error shape, from earlier in this session)
      rather than hitting the same `"{}"` bug one level down. This is
      what actually made the REST of this list debuggable at all - every
      fix below was found by reading a real, legible error for the
      first time instead of `"{}"`.
   2. **`crypto.getRandomValues` didn't exist on `require('crypto')`.**
      Real Node exposes it directly (not just via `.webcrypto`); this
      project's own vendored `crypto.js` used the real global
      internally (backing `randomBytes`/`randomUUID`) but never
      re-exported it as a top-level member. Real rolldown's own WASM
      binding loader calls `crypto.getRandomValues(...)` directly
      (presumably a nonce/id) - fixed with a one-line re-export,
      `.bind()`-ed the same way `randomUUID`'s own wrapper already is
      (Web Crypto API methods are WebIDL-brand-checked against their
      original object).
   3. **A real Worker-global-scope-vs-Node difference: `self` is a
      getter-only accessor in a real Worker, but real Node's
      worker_threads has no such restriction.** Real
      `@napi-rs/wasm-runtime`'s own `wasi-worker.mjs` (the fixed
      bootstrap file WASI's `thread-spawn` loads inside a
      `worker_threads.Worker` - see this doc's own earlier notes) does
      `Object.assign(globalThis, { self: globalThis, ... })` at its top
      level, assuming real Node's own unrestricted global object - every
      single WASI thread-spawn crashed with "Cannot set property self of
      #<WorkerGlobalScope> which has only a getter" the moment that line
      ran. Fixed in `workers/workerThreads/worker.ts`'s own boot() by
      redefining `self` as a plain writable data property before any
      guest code runs.

      **With all three fixed, the build got much further** - past
      "vite v8.2.2 building client environment for production..." (a
      real progress message that was never reached before) - into
      genuine WASM-side bundling work, for the first time.

   **Where it stops now: a real, unresolved design tension between two
   observed failure modes, neither of which is currently correct.**
   Real `@napi-rs/wasm-runtime`'s own worker-pool code calls
   `worker.unref()` on every pool worker immediately after spawning it
   (confirmed live by reading its own compiled `emnapi-plugins.cjs`) - a
   legitimate real-Node idle-efficiency pattern there, because a
   SEPARATE primitive (a libuv-level async handle backing whatever
   native N-API work is actually in flight, PLUS Emscripten's own
   runtime-keepalive counter - both confirmed to exist in the same
   compiled output via `envObject.ref()`/`.unref()` and
   `__emnapi_runtime_keepalive_push()` calls) independently keeps a real
   Node process alive for as long as real work is pending, regardless of
   the spawning Worker's own ref state. This runtime's own event loop
   has no equivalent second signal - only the Worker's own liveness ref
   this session already built:
   - **Honoring `unref()` (real Node's own semantics, and what's
     currently shipped)**: a real `vite build` exits successfully after
     printing only its first line, `dist/` never written - the pool
     worker's own real `unref()` call released the only signal keeping
     the process alive before the real bundling work even started.
     Confirmed live, repeatedly.
   - **Making `unref()` a permanent no-op (tried, reverted)**: traded
     that for a WORSE failure - a genuine infinite hang, confirmed live
     across two separate long-timeout runs (5 minutes, then 10 minutes),
     zero progress past the same first line either way. Real Node
     processes exit once a build's real async work finishes SPECIFICALLY
     because those pool workers are unref'd; permanently ignoring that
     means nothing this runtime can currently observe ever signals
     "done."
   Kept as real, honored semantics (the first option) rather than the
   no-op: a fast, clean, debuggable failure was judged better than a
   silent, resource-consuming hang with zero feedback - but neither is
   actually correct, and this is flagged as a real, open design question
   in `worker_threads.ts`'s own doc comment on `unref()`, not a settled
   answer. The real fix needs the actual missing signal: either (a)
   wiring real `eventLoop.ref()`/`unref()` calls to whatever this
   runtime can observe of `@emnapi/core`'s own `Env.ref()`/`unref()` (the
   real N-API-level keep-alive primitive `envObject` above is an
   instance of - not yet traced further: what `envObject` actually is,
   where it's constructed, or whether this runtime has any real hook
   into it at all from outside that library's own closures), or (b) a
   deliberately heuristic compromise (e.g. a delayed/debounced `unref()`
   that only actually releases after a period of no message traffic on
   any live `worker_threads.Worker`) if the real signal turns out to be
   unreachable from here. Not yet attempted - the next concrete step for
   whoever picks this up. (`vite --version` was re-verified working
   after every fix and revert in this list, including the final one -
   this regression is specific to real build-time WASM async work,
   `--version`'s own code path never reaches it.)

   **Follow-up, next session: implemented the debounced-`unref()` compromise
   listed as option (b) above, verified it's mechanically correct, then found
   the REAL blocker is a different, deeper bug it can't fix.**
   `worker_threads.ts`'s `DwcWorker.unref()` now debounces instead of
   releasing the liveness ref immediately: the ref is only actually dropped
   after `UNREF_DEBOUNCE_MS` (3000ms) of no message traffic (sent OR
   received) on that worker, extended by `#extendDebounce()` on every
   `postMessage()` call and every incoming `"message"` event. Unit-tested in
   isolation with `vi.useFakeTimers()` (`worker_threads.test.ts`) - 6 cases
   covering the debounce window, extension-on-traffic, `ref()` cancelling it,
   `terminate()` during a pending window, and the no-double-schedule guard.

   Re-verified live against a real `vite build`, instrumented down to
   individual `eventLoop.setTimeout`/`clearTimeout` calls and the literal
   content of every message sent/received on the pool worker (temporary
   diagnostics, since removed). Two things were conclusively established:
   - **The debounce mechanism itself is correct.** It inserts and holds a
     real pending timer in `eventLoop`'s own `timers` map; `#extendDebounce()`
     correctly clears and re-schedules it on real outgoing traffic - confirmed
     via two genuine extensions, one for `@napi-rs/wasm-runtime`'s own `"load"`
     message (handing the pool worker the wasm module + shared memory) and one
     for its `"start"` message (kicking off WASI thread id 43). Along the way,
     also found and fixed a real latent bug in `eventLoop.ts` itself: its own
     internal `runOnce()` used a bare, unqualified `setTimeout` in its
     timer-wait fallback branch, which - since `eventLoop.ts` is bundled into
     the same worker script as `workers/process/worker.ts`'s own
     `Object.assign(self, {setTimeout: ...})` override - resolved through the
     scope chain to that SAME guest-facing override once boot() had run,
     recursively feeding the event loop's own internal wait back into itself
     instead of using a real host timer. Fixed by capturing
     `globalThis.setTimeout` by reference at module load time (before any
     override can exist) and using that native reference internally. Real,
     worth keeping regardless of the outcome below - but built-and-verified
     (rebuilt, full 581/581 suite still green), it turned out NOT to be what
     was breaking the build either.
   - **The debounce is not what's blocking `vite build` - a different, deeper
     bug is.** Widened `UNREF_DEBOUNCE_MS` live to 20s and then 60s (temporary,
     reverted back to 3000 after): identical result both times. After
     `"start"` is sent to the pool worker, it never sends anything back - no
     ack, no error, nothing - for the entire widened window; the debounce
     timer simply runs out with zero further traffic and releases the ref
     right on schedule, exactly as designed. A longer debounce cannot fix
     this: the real bug is a silent stall somewhere in WASI thread-spawn
     execution itself, after the "start" message is delivered - inside
     `wasi-worker.mjs`'s own message handling, this project's `parentPort`
     relay in `workers/workerThreads/worker.ts`, or the actual wasm thread
     entry point never returning or replying. Confirmed via Playwright-level
     `page.on("worker")`/`worker.on("close")` listeners too: the nested WASI
     worker is still alive (never closes) when the test's own 5-minute
     deadline is reached - not a crash, a genuine indefinite stall. Not yet
     diagnosed further - the actual next concrete step for whoever picks this
     up, separate from (and downstream of) the ref/unref question this entry
     was originally about.

4. **HMR (hot module reload) — a real, unresolved design question, not
   just an implementation gap.** Vite's dev server pushes HMR updates over
   a `ws://` WebSocket the client page opens back to the dev server.
   Nothing in this stack implements WebSocket upgrade handling, and a
   Service Worker's `fetch` event **cannot** intercept a WebSocket
   handshake at all (`fetch` events don't fire for them) — the current
   architecture has no path for this. Options, in rough order of effort:
   skip HMR for a first version (Vite still works as a plain dev server
   without live reload, just without the live-reload part); implement a
   minimal in-VM WebSocket server (real Node `ws` upgrade handling is,
   like HTTP, not pure JS — another hand-written-parser-scale effort) plus
   a browser-side relay for the upgrade handshake specifically; or some
   other bridge not yet designed. Don't assume this is easy — flag it and
   decide deliberately before starting, the same way the zlib-vs-vendor
   and pure-JS-inflate decisions were surfaced explicitly earlier in this
   project rather than silently picked.

5. **Playground demo replaced with a real React app** (not yet reflected
   above since it landed after the ESM work's own PROGRESS.md entry).
   `examples/playground/src/main.ts` now does a real `npm install react@18
   react-dom@18` (pinned to 18, not `@latest`/19.x - React 19's
   `react-dom/server` pulls in `node:async_hooks`'s `AsyncLocalStorage`,
   which needs real V8 async-context propagation this runtime deliberately
   doesn't fake), then a real guest `http.createServer()` that `require()`s
   the actual installed React and server-renders a page with it on every
   request, previewed live through the Service Worker relay. No bundler/
   dev-server involved - deliberately takes the path that's fully working
   today rather than the still-blocked Vite dev-server path. Found and
   fixed one more real gap along the way: `util.TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`
   were missing (real Node re-exports the same globals from `require('util')`
   for backward compat; `react-dom/server`'s own bundled output relies on
   this).

6. **`npm create`/`npm init` — `vm`, `readline`, and real stdin all fixed;
   `npm exec`'s own spawn mechanics are next.** Real npm's own `promzard`
   dependency (used by `npm init`/`npm create` to evaluate a project's
   init-defaults script) does
   `const { runInThisContext } = require('vm')`, which crashed immediately
   with "Cannot find module 'vm'". Added a real `vm.runInThisContext()`
   (`runtime/builtins/vm.ts`) - scoped to exactly this one traced need, not
   the full `vm` module: real Node's `vm` is backed by native V8
   Context/Script bindings for true isolated-global-object sandboxing,
   which can't be replicated in userland JS at all, but `runInThisContext`
   specifically doesn't need that - real Node's own semantics for it are
   "shares the caller's real global scope, not an isolated sandbox" (that's
   what `runInNewContext`/`createContext` are for), which indirect `eval`
   already provides correctly, not merely approximately.
   `runInNewContext`/`createContext`/the `Script` class are deliberately
   left unimplemented rather than faking isolation, matching the
   `AsyncLocalStorage` precedent above.

   That unblocked npm's init flow only as far as a **different** gap:
   `Cannot find module 'readline'`, from the `read` package (npm's own
   interactive-prompt dependency, pulled in even with `-- --template
   vanilla` supplied to skip create-vite's own prompts). Investigating
   `readline`'s actual call site surfaced something bigger underneath it:
   **`dwc.process.spawn()`'s `.stdin` WritableStream had no path to the
   guest process at all** - `PROCESS_STDIN` requests had no handler
   anywhere in the kernel's router and were silently dropped by the host
   side's own `.catch(() => {})`. Fixed with a real end-to-end pipe
   (`processTable` now tracks the real Worker backing each process, kept
   deliberately separate from `ProcessEntry` itself since that's sent to
   the host via `PROCESS_LIST` and can't carry a raw `Worker` across
   structured clone; a new `PROCESS_STDIN` route forwards a chunk to that
   worker; the guest process worker exposes `process.stdin` as a real
   vendored `Readable`). Then added a real `readline` module
   (`runtime/builtins/readline.ts`) - scoped to "cooked mode" line reading
   (buffer bytes, split on newlines, emit one `'line'` event per complete
   line), not real Node's raw-mode/per-keystroke-echo/in-place-line-editing
   `readline` (which needs a real raw-mode TTY this runtime doesn't have -
   a real, documented gap for a caller driving this from a live interactive
   terminal, not silently faked).

   **Verified**: `npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template vanilla`,
   with a "y\n" written to the process's real `.stdin` a few seconds after
   spawning (auto-answering whatever confirmation prompt npm's own `exec`
   flow shows), now runs to **exit 0** with no missing-module errors at
   all. But the actual scaffolding didn't happen: `/create-vite-test` came
   back completely empty afterward, even though
   `/home/user/.npm/_npx/<hash>` shows npm's `exec` machinery DID fetch and
   cache `create-vite@9.2.0` correctly - the "> npx / > create-vite my-app
   --template vanilla" echo line printed (matching real npm's own
   about-to-run-this-command output), then nothing further, straight to a
   clean exit. This points at `npm exec`'s own mechanism for actually
   *launching* the fetched package (likely `@npmcli/promise-spawn`, a real
   `child_process.spawn()` wrapper - possibly needing `shell: true` or
   another `child_process` option/mode this runtime's own spawn
   implementation doesn't yet support) rather than anything about
   `vm`/`readline`/stdin, which are now all confirmed working correctly.
   Not yet investigated further - the next "run it, find the next break"
   candidate for whoever picks this up, separate from the Vite-dev-server
   gaps in item 3.

   **Follow-up, next session: found and fixed the actual silent-failure bug,
   then traced the real remaining gap two layers deep.**

   The "clean exit, nothing happened" symptom was a real bug in this
   runtime's own `child_process.js`, not npm doing anything unusual. `spawn()`'s
   `onExit` handler, on a resolution failure (command not found), deferred only
   the `'error'` event via `process.nextTick(() => child.emit("error", err))`
   but emitted `'exit'`/`'close'` *synchronously* right after, in the same
   call - so `'close'` (with `code=null, signal=null`, both falsy) always fired
   before the deferred `'error'`. Real npm's own `@npmcli/promise-spawn`
   (`spawn()`'s actual caller here) does exactly `proc.on('error', reject)` and
   `proc.on('close', (code, signal) => code || signal ? reject() : resolve())`
   - a Promise's first settlement wins, so `'close'` firing first with two
   falsy values silently *resolved* the promise as if the command had
   succeeded, before `'error'` ever got a chance to reject it. This wasn't
   `npm exec`-specific - it silently swallowed EVERY `spawn()` resolution
   failure system-wide, for any caller shaped like `promise-spawn`. Fixed by
   deferring all three events (`error`, `exit`, `close`) into the same
   `process.nextTick`, preserving their relative order (matching real Node,
   which emits `'error'` before `'exit'`/`'close'` for a failed spawn) while
   still giving a caller time to attach its own `'error'` listener
   asynchronously.

   Re-verified live (`npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template vanilla`,
   same harness as above): the silent no-op is now a real, honestly-reported
   failure - `npm error code ENOENT` / `npm error enoent sh: command not
   found`, exit code 1 - instead of a misleading clean exit 0 with an empty
   directory. That's the actual root cause surfacing for the first time,
   traced further:

   Real npm's own `@npmcli/run-script` (`lib/make-spawn-args.js`) always
   builds its script-running spawn with `shell: scriptShell` (default `true`
   unless a caller overrides it), which `@npmcli/promise-spawn`'s own
   `spawnWithShell()` turns into a literal `child_process.spawn('sh', ['-c',
   '<command line>'], {...})` - confirmed exactly this shape live via the
   error above. Two things are needed to make that actually run something,
   neither of which exists in this runtime yet:
   1. **No dispatch for `sh -c "<line>"` in `spawn()` at all.** `resolveEntryPoint()`
      (`workers/kernel/processClient.ts`) only ever resolves a literal `/bin/
      <command>.js` or a `node <script>` invocation - there is no `sh`/`bash`
      program, vendored or otherwise (`kernel/fs/coreutils.ts`'s own list:
      `echo`, `pwd`, `true`, `false`, `cat`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `mv` - no
      shell). This project already has a working, if deliberately minimal,
      shell-line interpreter (`shell/tokenize.ts`'s `&&`/`>`-only tokenizer,
      currently only wired up for `child_process.exec()`/`dwc.shell.exec()`
      via `runShellInternal()`) that could plausibly back a `sh -c` dispatch
      for `spawn()` too - but that path is buffered (accumulates one `output`
      string, returns only at the end), not streamed the way `cp-spawn`'s
      protocol otherwise delivers stdout/stderr progressively; reusing it
      as-is would mean `spawn()`'s streaming contract silently degrades to
      "all output arrives at once, at exit" for anything shell-dispatched.
   2. **No PATH-based executable resolution anywhere in this runtime.**
      Real npm's own `setPATH()` (`@npmcli/run-script/lib/set-path.js`) is
      what's supposed to make `create-vite` (fetched into some real npm cache
      directory, never `/bin/`) resolvable by name inside that `sh -c` line -
      it works by prepending the fetched package's own bin directory onto
      `env.PATH`, then relying on `sh` to search `PATH` for `create-vite` when
      resolving the command word. `resolveEntryPoint()` has no notion of
      `PATH` at all - it is hardcoded to exactly `/bin/<command>.js`, nothing
      else, ever. Even with (1) fixed, `create-vite` would still resolve to
      "command not found" without this.

   **Follow-up, same session: built both, then found and fixed two more real
   bugs live-testing them - `npm create vite@latest` now works completely,
   end to end, for the first time.**

   1. **`resolveEntryPoint()` now does a real PATH search.** Given an `env`
      parameter, a bare command word that isn't `/bin/<name>.js` now searches
      each `env.PATH.split(':')` directory in order (first match wins,
      matching POSIX `execvp`) before giving up - threaded through from every
      call site that has a real `env` available (`cp-spawn`, `execFileSync`'s
      kernel-side backer). A resolved candidate is then run through a new
      `resolveRealEntryPath()` helper (`fsClient.request({action:
      "realpath", ...})`, already a supported VFS op, just never called from
      here before) before being used as an entryPath - real npm's own bin-
      linking creates `node_modules/.bin/<name>` as a genuine symlink into
      the package's own directory, and real Node's module resolution uses
      the symlink's REAL target directory (not the symlink's own location)
      as the base for that module's relative `require()`s. Skipping this
      step is exactly what the second bug below surfaced as - a resolved
      but wrongly-based entry point, not a resolution failure.
   2. **`child_process.spawn()` now has a real `sh -c "<line>"` dispatch
      path.** A new `runShellLineStreamed()` (`workers/kernel/
      processClient.ts`) reuses the exact same `shell/tokenize.ts`
      interpreter `runShellInternal`/`cp-exec` already use, but relays each
      resulting command's stdout/stderr AS PRODUCED via the same streaming
      `bootProcess()`/`cp-event` machinery an ordinary `cp-spawn` uses,
      instead of `runShellInternal`'s buffered single-string-then-return
      shape - matching `spawn()`'s real streaming contract, which real npm's
      own promise-based consumers (`@npmcli/promise-spawn`) actually rely
      on. `cp-spawn`'s handler now special-cases `command === "sh" &&
      args[0] === "-c"` (real npm's own `@npmcli/run-script` always spawns
      scripts, including `npm exec`/`npx`'s fetched-package launch, exactly
      this way) and dispatches here instead of the normal single-
      resolveEntryPoint-then-bootProcess path. A command with a `>` redirect
      still goes through the older buffered `runProgramViaShell` (streaming
      stdout while redirecting it to a file doesn't make sense), now also
      given `env` for the same PATH-search reason.
   3. **A missing default `PATH` silently made (1) a no-op.** Real npm's own
      `setPATH()` (`@npmcli/run-script/lib/set-path.js`) only ever UPDATES an
      existing PATH-shaped key in the env object it's given - it never adds
      one from scratch. This runtime's guest `process.env` had no `PATH` key
      at all by default (never needed before - `resolveEntryPoint`'s
      original `/bin/<name>.js` lookup is PATH-independent), so that update
      was silently a no-op and (1) never had anything to search. Fixed with
      a real, minimal default (`PATH: "/bin"`) in `apis/Process.ts`'s own
      `spawn()`, overridable by a caller's own `options.env.PATH` - confirmed
      live via a temporary diagnostic (`PATH= undefined` before this fix).
   4. **`fs.copyFileSync` didn't exist at all.** Found live, past both bugs
      above: real `create-vite`'s own scaffolding step (copying a template's
      static files into the target directory) calls it directly - `TypeError:
      t.copyFileSync is not a function`. Added as a straightforward
      `readFileSync`+`writeFileSync` composition in `runtime/builtins/fs.ts`
      (single-file copy only - no traced need yet for `fs.cpSync`'s
      recursive-tree form).

   **Verified live, full end-to-end run** (`npm create vite@latest my-app --
   --template vanilla`, same harness as every other entry in this section):
   exit code 0, and `/my-app` now contains real, correct scaffolded output -
   `.gitignore`, `index.html`, `package.json`, `public/`, `src/{assets,
   counter.js, main.js, style.css}` - the actual real-vite `vanilla` template,
   not an empty directory. This is the first time `npm create`/`npx` has
   worked completely in this runtime. The four bugs above were found and
   fixed in sequence, each live run's own error message pointing at exactly
   the next one - `sh: command not found` → `create-vite: command not found`
   (missing default PATH) → `Cannot find module './dist/index.js' from
   .../node_modules/.bin/create-vite` (symlink realpath) → `TypeError:
   t.copyFileSync is not a function` → real success.

## 7. Real vite dev server actually starts — MAJOR MILESTONE (new session)

Continuing right where item 3 left off, now that scaffolding works: ran
`npm create vite@latest` → `npm install` → `npm run dev` end-to-end, in
`examples/playground`, repeatedly, fixing whatever broke next (same method
as everywhere else in this file). Three more real, previously-unknown
runtime gaps, each confirmed by getting the dev server further before
hitting the next one - all found via `dwc.process.spawn()`'s own stdout/
stderr, decoded from `window.__fullLog` chunks the way earlier debugging
in this file used direct diagnostics (huge single console.log calls choke
an automated console reader - the terminal's xterm DOM also only ever
holds the visible viewport, not full scrollback, so neither was usable for
a 40-150MB error dump on its own):

1. **`readdirSync` ignored `{ withFileTypes: true }` entirely**, always
   returning bare filename strings - real Vite's own filesystem walk calls
   `readdir(dir, { withFileTypes: true })` then `dirent.isSymbolicLink()`
   on each entry, crashing on startup with "dirent.isSymbolicLink is not a
   function" (a string has no such method). Fixed via `lstat` per entry
   (no cheaper way to get a type from one `readdir` round-trip in this
   VFS); threaded through the sync, callback, and `fs/promises` forms.
2. **`crypto.hash()` didn't exist** - real rolldown/vite's own `getHash()`
   helper calls this synchronous one-shot form directly (not
   `createHash().update().digest()`) to fingerprint a module's source for
   its dependency-optimizer cache. Added as a thin wrapper over the
   already-real `createHash`.
3. **`fs.watch()` didn't exist at all** - real Vite's own config/dependency
   watcher (chokidar's fallback `createFsWatchInstance`) calls it at
   *startup*, not only for live-reload. This VFS has no push-based change-
   notification mechanism (every fs op is a synchronous request/response
   round-trip), so the implementation deliberately doesn't detect real
   changes - same "exists and is callable, doesn't fake infrastructure
   this runtime doesn't have" precedent as `vm.runInNewContext`/
   `worker_threads.Worker` elsewhere. Real hot-reload-on-change remains
   the separately-tracked open design question (item 4 above).

All three: unit tested, `tsc --noEmit` clean, committed, pushed.

**After all three: real Vite's dev server, backed by the real rolldown
WASM/WASI fallback chain (item 3's own `execFileSync`+pnpm-shim+WASI
work), successfully printed its own real startup banner and reached the
point of calling `dwc.preview.enable()` - i.e. it actually started.** This
is the first time in this project's history a real, unmodified `npm run
dev` (Vite, via rolldown) has booted successfully inside the sandbox, not
just resolved its dependency graph or gotten past an import error.

**What's NOT yet confirmed: whether the guest server actually accepted a
connection.** The preview iframe (and a plain direct `fetch()` to the same
`__dwc_preview__` URL, same result) showed `dwc preview relay error: ...
nothing is listening on port 5173` - the exact same failure mode section 0
above investigated at length for the docs site's own Playground demo, and
concluded (there, independently reconfirmed by another session's 23/23
clean retest) was a Service-Worker/browser-profile-state artifact from
repeated test churn, not a code defect. This session's own test tab had
already undergone several reloads and one memory-pressure crash (from
buffering ~150MB of decoded error text into a plain JS array while
debugging bug #1 above - don't do that; read `window.__fullLog` in small
slices instead) by the time this specific run happened, so the same
profile-state explanation is the leading one here too, but this specific
combination (npm's own child-process spawn chain → real vite → real
rolldown-over-WASI → the preview relay) has NOT been separately re-tested
in a clean profile the way the docs-site case was. That is the concrete
next step - not assumed, since this is a materially different call path
than the docs site's.

**If picking this up:** re-run the same `npm create vite` → `npm install`
→ `npm run dev` cycle in a genuinely fresh Chrome profile/incognito
window (each full cycle takes several real minutes - two real npm-registry
installs, one of them the WASM binding package). Watch for the literal
`Local:` string in stdout (confirms Vite's real ready banner was actually
printed - it did appear in the one successful run so far) and then check whether the
preview iframe actually renders the guest server's page. If it does, this
whole thread (items 1, 2, 3, 7) is complete: real npm install, real npm
create, and a real running Vite dev server previewed live, all working
end-to-end for the first time. If the "nothing is listening" error
reproduces there too, that upgrades it from "probably a testing artifact"
to "a real bug in this specific call path" and warrants the same kind of
direct-fetch-vs-SW-relay diagnostic section 0 used (expose the `dwc`
instance, call `dwc.preview.fetch(port, path)` directly to check whether
the *kernel* thinks something is listening, independent of the Service
Worker relay - that's the fastest way to tell which side is actually
wrong). HMR (item 4) is still a wholly separate, unstarted question even
once this is resolved - what's being verified here is a working `vite
dev`, not live-reload-on-edit.

## 8. `npm run dev` never reaches its ready banner — root cause fully identified, fix in progress (currently mid-flight, safe state, do not assume solved)

### TL;DR for whoever picks this up next

Real `npm run dev`, backed by real rolldown/WASI, gets all the way
through scaffolding, install, and vite's own startup — but its dev server
never actually finishes coming up, so the preview always shows `nothing
is listening on port 5173`. **This is a real, 100%-reproducible bug in
this runtime, not a browser-profile artifact, a port mismatch, or a
timing/patience issue** — all three were suspected at different points
and all three are now disproven with direct evidence (details below).

The root cause is now known precisely: a real native plugin inside
rolldown (`builtin:oxc-runtime`) makes an async call into Rust/WASM code
during vite's startup, and that call **never resolves or rejects — it
hangs forever** from the guest script's point of view. The reason it
hangs: the native code signals "keep me alive, I'm not done yet" using a
real Node.js API (`MessagePort.ref()`/`.unref()`) that this runtime's
`MessageChannel` didn't implement, so every one of those calls was a
silently-swallowed no-op. The runtime's own housekeeping (`drain()`)
correctly-by-its-own-rules concludes "nothing is happening" a few seconds
later and shuts the whole process down — mid-flight, silently, before
vite's dev server ever finishes starting.

**Two attempts to fix this (wiring `MessagePort.ref()`/`.unref()` into
the real event loop) both froze the browser tab solid on a live test, at
two different points in the flow.** Both were reverted. A follow-up
*isolated* test (the override alone, stress-tested with thousands of
`ref()`/`unref()` calls and hundreds of `MessageChannel`s, no vite/
rolldown involved at all) ran cleanly in ~200ms with zero issues — so the
override's basic mechanics are NOT the problem; something about its
interaction with the real vite/rolldown/WASM pipeline is. **As of this
writing, the fix code IS present in the working tree** (`eventLoop.ts`,
`builtins/worker_threads.ts`, `workers/process/worker.ts` all have
uncommitted-or-just-committed changes — check `git log`/`git status` to
see which) **and has only passed the isolated test, not a live end-to-end
run.** Do not assume it works. Do not run the full `npm create vite` →
`npm install` → `npm run dev` demo against it without being ready for a
tab freeze (poll responsiveness every ~10s rather than waiting blindly —
see the technique notes at the end of this section).

### How this was found: the full diagnostic chain, in order

**1. Disproving "it's a browser-profile artifact."** A near-identical
"nothing is listening" failure had been seen once before in this
project, for a *different* demo (the docs site), and was concluded there
to be a stale-Service-Worker/browser-profile issue, not a real bug
(independently reconfirmed by another session's 23/23 clean retest). It
was reasonable to suspect the same explanation applied here — but a
direct kernel-level check, `dwc.preview.fetch(5173, '/')` (bypasses the
Service Worker relay entirely, asks the kernel directly "is anything
registered on this port"), **also failed** with the same error. That
kernel-level check always succeeded in the docs-site case. So this is a
different, real problem specific to this call path — not the same
profile-state artifact.

**2. Finding a real, separate bug on the way: `waitForMarker()` masks
failure.** `examples/playground/src/main.ts`'s `waitForMarker()` helper
(waits for the literal string `"Local:"` in a stream before proceeding)
has a bug: it also resolves when the stream simply *closes* (EOF), not
only when the marker text is actually seen. This means the demo silently
proceeds to `dwc.preview.enable()` regardless of whether vite ever
actually became ready — "nothing is listening" is the *symptom* this
masking bug lets through, not the disease itself. **Still unfixed** —
worth fixing independently of the root cause below, so future runs
visibly report "dev server exited before printing Local:" instead of
silently continuing to a preview that was never going to work.

**3. Confirming the port is correct (ruling out a port mismatch).** Asked
live, mid-session: "maybe it's listening on a different port?" Traced the
low-level `net-pipe-listen` registrations rolldown/vite's dev server
process actually makes — all of them carry `{ port: 5173 }`, every single
time. **Not a port mismatch.**

**4. Confirming vite's process really does try to listen, and really
does exit cleanly (not crash) shortly after.** Traced the full spawn
chain live: `npm run dev` → `@npmcli/run-script` → `promiseSpawn` →
`child_process.spawn('sh', ['-c', 'vite'], { stdio: 'inherit' })` → this
runtime's own `cp-spawn`/`runShellLineStreamed` dispatch → `vite` resolved
to `/my-app/node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js` → booted as a real nested
process worker. That process worker genuinely calls the low-level
`net.Server.listen()` binding (three times — see #6 below for why), then
**exits cleanly** — `postEvent("exit", { code: 0 })`, zero stderr, zero
thrown error. That clean exit is exactly what npm's own real
`lib/cli/exit-handler.js:171` (`this.#process.exit(exitCode)`) reacts to:
`@npmcli/promise-spawn`'s `proc.on('close', ...)` fires with `code: 0`,
so `run-script`'s promise resolves successfully, and npm's own CLI entry
calls `process.exit(0)` right on schedule. **npm, the kernel's `cp-spawn`
relay, and the shell dispatch are all faithfully reporting a real,
premature exit of vite's own process — none of them are the bug.** Vite's
own "ready" output (the `VITE vX.X.X ready in Yms` banner, or the `➜
Local:   http://localhost:5173/` line every real `vite` invocation prints
immediately after a successful listen) never appears, in any run.

**5. Ruling out several plausible explanations, each with a direct,
live-tested repro** (technique: write a small script to `/bin/<name>.js`,
`dwc.process.spawn()` it directly — much faster than the full multi-
minute `npm create vite` → `npm install` cycle for testing one hypothesis
at a time):
   - **Not the `execFileSync`+pnpm-install-the-WASI-binding step.**
     Reproduced standalone (both a fresh download+install and a cache-hit
     require of the already-installed binding) — both return cleanly and
     fast (seconds), no hang, no partial state. The binding module loads
     and returns a fully-formed native object (`BindingDevEngine`,
     `startAsyncRuntime`, etc. all present).
   - **Not `drain()`'s idle-exit timeout (`DRAIN_GRACE_YIELDS`)** — the
     mechanism that tears a process down after enough consecutive idle
     macrotask yields with no tracked pending work. Bumped it twice, 1000x
     then 10,000x (20 → 20,000 → 200,000) with real timestamps on both
     sides of the gap: the process died at the *same* point and the
     *same* ~2.6-9s mark regardless (the range reflects different patch
     revisions' own tracing overhead, not a real change from the bump).
     This isn't "the guest's native promise chain just needed a few more
     yields" — proven twice, not just guessed.
   - **Not an uncaught exception.** This runtime's own fatal-exception
     path always writes stderr and exits with code 1; this exit is code 0
     with zero stderr, going through a different path entirely (see the
     root cause below).
   - **Not a kernel-side relay bug.** Every hop of the spawn chain in #4
     was individually traced and each is a correct, faithful forwarding
     of what vite's own process worker actually did.
   - **Not a hung synchronous fs call inside a nested `worker_threads.
     Worker`** (the leading hypothesis for a while, since rolldown's own
     WASI support needs `worker_threads.Worker` for its `thread-spawn`
     import). A minimal repro — spawn a real nested Worker whose only job
     is `fs.readFileSync()` and post the result back — completed in under
     50ms. Basic worker_threads + sync-fs is fine.
   - **Not obviously a missing `eventLoop.ref()` on `net.Server.listen()`**
     either, on inspection — `bindings/net.ts`'s existing `recount()`
     logic (shared by `TCP`/`Pipe`) correctly refs/unrefs based on
     liveness. (This one is subtler — see #6.)

**6. Finding that the three `listen` calls were never the real bind.**
Real vite's own source (`npm pack vite@8.2.2` and read it directly) shows
`httpServerStart()` calls `isPortAvailable(port)` **before** ever
attempting the real bind — probing the port once per entry in vite's own
`wildcardHosts` Set, which has **exactly three** entries (`"0.0.0.0"`,
`"::"`, and the same address in a third notation — vite doesn't dedupe
them). Each probe opens a throwaway `net.createServer()` and **closes it
immediately** once `'listening'` fires. Those are the exact three
`listen` events traced in #4 — all probes, all closed right away, none of
them the real, lasting server. Only *after* all three report the port
free does vite call the real bind — but by then, vite has already
overridden `httpServer.listen` (in `_createServer()`) to run its own
`initServer(true)` first: `await environments.client.pluginContainer
.buildStart()`, then `await Promise.all(environments.map(e =>
e.listen(server)))`, and *only then* the real, original low-level
`listen(port, host)`. **So the real bind — and vite's own ready banner —
are gated behind `pluginContainer.buildStart()`, a call into rolldown's
own native/WASM machinery**, and the process reliably dies during exactly
that gap: a fourth `listen` event (the real one) never appears, in any
run. A direct, timed repro of this exact gap (bypassing npm and the shell
dispatch entirely, spawning `vite/bin/vite.js` directly with
`Date.now()`-timestamped tracing patched into the guest VFS copy of
vite's own `node.js`) confirmed it precisely: `before buildStart <T>`
logs, then **nothing else ever** — no `after buildStart`, no further
trace, no error — before the process exits with code 0.

**7. Finding the exact hanging call inside `buildStart()`.** Patched
vite's own `hookParallel()` (the loop `buildStart()` uses to run every
plugin's `buildStart` hook) with per-plugin timestamped tracing — **every
plugin's `buildStart` hook completes in under 3ms**, all 8 of them.
`buildStart()` itself isn't the hang. What runs immediately after it
resolves, per vite's own source (`_registerInputsAsSafeModules()`), is
`pluginContainer.resolveId("index.html", ..., { isEntry: true, scan:
true })` — and *that* is where it hangs. Patched vite's `resolveId`
plugin loop the same way:

```
resolveId START builtin:oxc-runtime rawId=index.html <T>
```

...and nothing else, ever. No `resolveId DONE`, no error, for that
plugin, across every run. The process exits ~2.6-2.7s later.

**8. Tracing `builtin:oxc-runtime` down to real native code.**
`builtin:oxc-runtime` is not a JS plugin. Reading rolldown's own real
source (`npm pack rolldown@1.2.7`) shows `oxcRuntimePlugin()`
(`src/builtin-plugin/constructors.ts`) constructs a `BuiltinPlugin` and
wraps it via `makeBuiltinPluginCallable()` (`src/builtin-plugin/utils.ts`),
which does:

```js
let callablePlugin = new import_binding.BindingCallableBuiltinPlugin(...);
const wrappedHook = async function(...args) {
  return await callablePlugin[key](...args);   // key = "resolveId" here
};
```

**So `resolveId` for this plugin is a direct call into native Rust/WASM
code** (`BindingCallableBuiltinPlugin`, one of the native binding's own
exported classes) via NAPI-RS bridging — not JS at all. The `await` on
that native async method call is what never settles. Tested and ruled
out: manually calling `nativeBinding.startAsyncRuntime()` before vite
ever runs does NOT fix it — the call itself returns successfully (no
throw), and the exact same hang at the exact same point still happens
right after.

**9. Finding the real mechanism: a real Node.js API this runtime never
implemented.** Reading the actual dependency chain, one `npm pack` at a
time:
   - `@rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi`'s own loader
     (`rolldown-binding.wasi.cjs`) instantiates via
     `instantiateNapiModuleSync(..., { plugins: [emnapiAsyncWorkPlugin,
     emnapiTSFNPlugin] })` — **the JS-emulated, single-threaded async-work
     path**, not real shared-memory threads. (This is why the
     `worker_threads`/thread-spawn angle in #5 was a dead end from the
     start — this specific call was never going through real threads.)
   - `@napi-rs/wasm-runtime`'s own doc comment explains why: single-
     threaded WASI builds link an emnapi archive whose C async-work/
     threadsafe-function implementations are unconditional
     `napi_generic_failure` stubs, so *JS* implementations
     (`emnapiAsyncWorkPlugin`/`emnapiTSFNPlugin`, from `@emnapi/core`)
     provide them instead.
   - `@emnapi/runtime`'s own source (`dist/emnapi.js`) shows exactly how
     that JS-level implementation signals "don't let the process exit
     while this native async call is pending": `this.refHandle = new
     MessageChannel().port1`, then later `if (this.refHandle.ref) {
     this.refHandle.ref() }` / the matching guarded `.unref()`. **This is
     Node's real `MessagePort.ref()`/`.unref()` contract** — a real Node
     `MessagePort` supports these; a real *browser* `MessagePort` does
     not. This runtime's own `MessageChannel` was a plain, unwrapped
     browser-native one, so every one of these calls was a silently-
     swallowed no-op the whole time. Nothing ties emnapi's own "is native
     async work still pending" signal to this runtime's own
     `eventLoop.ref()`/`unref()` at all — so from `drain()`'s point of
     view, a queued `resolveId()` call on `builtin:oxc-runtime` looks
     exactly like "nothing happening," even while it's genuinely still in
     flight. **This is the root cause.**

### Fix attempts (two so far, both reverted — read before trying a third)

**Attempt 1 — naive 1:1 wiring.** Overrode the guest-global
`MessageChannel` (in `worker.ts`'s own `Object.assign(self, {...})`
block, alongside where `setTimeout`/`setImmediate` already get Node-
shaping) so its ports carry real, idempotent `.ref()`/`.unref()` wired
straight into `eventLoop.ref()`/`unref()` — the same pattern
`bindings/net.ts`'s `recount()` already uses for TCP/Pipe handles.
Typechecked, all 584 unit tests passing, rebuilt clean. **Live-tested
against the real end-to-end demo and it made things worse: the browser
tab's own renderer froze solid** (every `javascript_exec`/screenshot call
timed out after 45s with "the renderer may be frozen or unresponsive"),
reproduced twice in separate fresh tabs, at roughly the point the demo
used to cleanly (if wrongly) exit — i.e., right around `resolveId()`.
Reverted immediately.

Leading (unconfirmed — the frozen tab couldn't be inspected further)
theory: a livelock, not a deadlock. `eventLoop.ts`'s own `wake()` fires on
every `ref()`/`unref()` call. If `emnapiAsyncWorkPlugin`'s own JS-emulated
polling toggles this port's ref state at high frequency (plausible, as a
substitute for what would otherwise be a blocking native wait), real
ref-counting turns each toggle into a real wake-and-recheck cycle —
something that cost nothing as a no-op could saturate the event loop once
it actually does something.

**Attempt 2 — debounced.** Same override, but `wrapRefPort` now debounces
release through a real, *untracked* host timer (specifically NOT
`eventLoop.setTimeout`, which would itself call `wake()` on every single
`unref()` and reintroduce the same problem one level down): `.ref()`
cancels any pending release and re-refs immediately if not already ref'd;
`.unref()` starts (or leaves running) a `REF_PORT_DEBOUNCE_MS = 100`
window that only calls `eventLoop.unref()` once it fires with no
intervening `.ref()` — same shape as `worker_threads.ts`'s own
`UNREF_DEBOUNCE_MS`. Building this also surfaced a real, independent bug
worth keeping regardless of the rest of this fix: `eventLoop.ts`'s own
`yieldToMicrotasks()` had a bare, uncaptured `new MessageChannel()` — the
exact "a global override will shadow this once boot() runs" hazard its
neighboring `nativeSetTimeout` comment already documents for `setTimeout`
specifically, just never applied to `MessageChannel` too. Fixed alongside
(both `eventLoop.ts` and `worker_threads.ts`'s own `DwcMessageChannel`
now capture `nativeMessageChannel` at module load, matching
`nativeSetTimeout`'s existing precedent) — this part is correct and safe
independent of anything else in this section.

Typechecked, 584 tests passing, rebuilt. **Live-tested again — this time
polling tab responsiveness every ~10s instead of waiting blindly, which
is exactly how this was caught: froze again, but at a DIFFERENT point** —
not during `resolveId`/`oxc-runtime` this time, but earlier, during the
`[rolldown] Downloading @rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi@1.2.7 on
WebContainer...`/`execFileSync` step, before `buildStart()` or any native
plugin hook had even run. Reverted again.

**Two different freeze locations across two different fix shapes is a
meaningful signal**: it points away from "ref/unref frequency on one
specific call" and toward something more structural about globally
overriding `MessageChannel` at all — maybe how broadly a global override
reaches (literally every `new MessageChannel()` in this worker's realm,
including inside real vendored library code with its own assumptions),
maybe something about the wrapped object's shape. The debounce logic
specifically was never even exercised by the second freeze (it happened
before any native async-work call would run), which rules out "the
debounce math has a bug" as the explanation for *that* occurrence.

**Follow-up isolated test — clean, no freeze.** Per the plan below, wrote
a tiny standalone script (no vite, no rolldown, no npm at all) exercising
the override alone: one basic channel+ref/unref, 200 `MessageChannel`s
created in a loop (mimicking `yieldToMicrotasks()`'s own repeated usage),
5000 rapid *synchronous* `ref()`/`unref()` toggles on one port, and 500
*async* (one microtask apart) toggles. All four levels completed in
**~216ms total, exit code 0, no freeze, tab fully responsive
immediately after.** This means the override's basic mechanics — channel
creation, message passing, ref/unref bookkeeping, even under real stress
— are NOT the problem. Whatever causes the freeze only shows up in
combination with the real vite/rolldown/WASM pipeline specifically -
narrower than before, but still not pinned down.

**Current repo state:** the debounced fix (attempt 2, plus the
independent `nativeMessageChannel`-capture correctness fixes) was
re-applied after the isolated test passed, and is committed as `c659c31`.

**Follow-up session: re-verified live against the real end-to-end demo —
confirmed NOT sufficient, and found a new, more precise failure signature.**
Rebuilt `@dwc/core` (dist was stale relative to `c659c31`), then drove the
real `examples/playground` demo (`npm create vite` → `npm install` → `npm
run dev`) with a Playwright script polling tab responsiveness every 10s via
`document.readyState`, per this doc's own prior recommendation.

Result: `npm create vite` (exit 0) and `npm install` (exit 0, `added 13
packages in 1m`) both succeeded exactly as before. `npm run dev` printed
`[rolldown] Downloading @rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi@1.2.7 on
WebContainer...` and then **nothing further, ever** — no `Local:` banner,
no error, no exit — reproducing the exact same stall as the pre-fix
baseline (section 7's "execFileSync"-area freeze location). The debounced
`MessageChannel` fix does not unstick this.

**New signal, not previously observed:** this time the tab's main thread
never froze — `document.readyState` polling kept succeeding instantly for
16+ minutes straight. Direct OS-level process inspection (`ps`/`top -H` on
the Chromium renderer process) told the real story: the main render thread
sat at 0% CPU the entire time, while **one Dedicated Worker thread was
pinned at ~100% CPU continuously for the full 16+ minutes**, accumulating
CPU time linearly with zero forward progress in the demo's own output.
This is a real, live-observed **livelock confined to a background worker**
— not a deadlock, not a frozen tab, not insufficient patience, and (since
the port-5173 "nothing is listening" symptom was never even reached this
time — the hang is upstream of vite's real bind) not the same failure mode
as section 7's original "browser-profile artifact" concern either.

This matches, and now directly confirms with process-level evidence, the
"livelock, not deadlock" theory from Attempt 1's postmortem above (a
ref/unref toggle loop turning what used to be a harmless no-op into a real
wake-and-recheck cycle that never settles) — it just surfaces as a pinned
worker thread instead of a fully frozen tab this time, which is why the
tab-freeze-detection method this doc previously relied on (polling
`document.readyset`/`javascript_exec` responsiveness) did NOT catch it as
a freeze at all. **A responsiveness poll on the main thread is not a
reliable signal for this bug** — future verification needs to check OS-level
CPU usage per-thread (`ps -o pid,time,%cpu` / `top -H -p <renderer-pid>`
inside the browser's own renderer process), not just tab responsiveness.

**Not yet done:** identifying exactly which loop is spinning inside that
pinned worker thread (the debounced `wrapRefPort`'s own timer logic in
`worker_threads.ts`, `@emnapi/core`'s JS-emulated async-work polling, or
something else in the rolldown/WASI chain) — no JS-level stack sample was
taken of the pinned thread before killing it. That's the concrete next
step: reproduce again, then attempt to get a CPU profile of the pinned
Dedicated Worker specifically (e.g. via the CDP `Profiler` domain against
that worker's own target, if Playwright/CDP can address a nested worker
directly) rather than guessing from the mechanism alone.

**Immediate re-run, same session: reproduced again, faster, with a finer-
grained CPU pattern than the first observation — profiling attempt blocked
by tooling, not yet by design.** Re-ran the same demo a second time,
this time watching OS-level per-thread CPU (`top -H -p <renderer-pid>`)
from the very start via a Monitor loop, instead of only noticing it after
16 minutes.

- **The livelock this time started ~21 seconds after the "Downloading..."
  line** (much faster than needing 16 minutes to notice) - a Dedicated
  Worker thread pinned at 93-100% CPU. Unlike the first observation
  (flat 100% for the entire 16+ minutes straight), this run's CPU pattern
  **oscillated**: a continuous ~4-minute hot stretch, a few-second cool
  dip, hot again, repeating - not a perfectly flat spin, but a real,
  sustained one all the same. **Zero new stdout/stderr appeared for the
  entire ~15.5 minutes this run was allowed to continue** (confirmed via
  the same `[out]`-tailing log used throughout this investigation) -
  ruling out the alternative read that the CPU burst was just legitimate
  slow-but-working install activity (real npm install of these packages
  was independently confirmed fast - "seconds" - in isolation per
  diagnostic #5 above; a real, if slower, install would also eventually
  print *something*, which never happened here either run).
- **Attempted to get an actual JS/native stack sample of the pinned
  thread, blocked by environment tooling, not a design limitation of the
  approach itself**: `perf` is not installed in this environment;
  `strace -p <tid>` is present but refused with `ptrace(PTRACE_SEIZE):
  Operation not permitted` (`/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope` = 1,
  same-uid attach still restricted here); `/proc/<tid>/stack` and
  `/proc/<tid>/syscall` both `Permission denied`. What WAS confirmed via
  `/proc/<tid>/status`/`wchan`: the thread's state is `R` (running, not
  blocked) with `wchan: 0` (not parked in a kernel wait) - i.e., this is
  definitely genuine userspace CPU-bound spinning, not a thread blocked
  on a syscall/futex that merely *looks* busy in `ps`. That's consistent
  with (though doesn't yet prove) the "livelock via a JS-level loop"
  theory over any kind of native-side blocking wait.
- **Also ruled out, by reading the source directly**: the two other
  `new MessageChannel()` call sites in this codebase
  (`workers/kernel/processClient.ts` lines ~173 and ~210, backing the
  sync-fs channel grant and the sync-exec channel respectively) are NOT
  affected by `worker.ts`'s debounced global-`MessageChannel` override -
  they run inside the **kernel worker**, a separate bundled worker
  script that never calls the **process worker's** own `boot()` (the
  only place `Object.assign(self, {MessageChannel: ...})` happens). So
  the debounced override provably cannot be the direct cause of whatever
  is spinning during the execFileSync/pnpm-install window specifically -
  at this point in the flow, nothing has yet `require()`d
  `@napi-rs/wasm-runtime`/`@emnapi/core` (the ONLY real caller of the
  wrapped global `MessageChannel`), so that code path isn't even reached
  yet. This narrows, but does not yet resolve, the open question: same
  hang location as this doc's own "Attempt 2" already recorded, still
  unexplained, still correlated with the fix's mere presence in the
  built bundle for reasons not yet identified (memory/timing perturbation
  from the larger bundle? something else in the execFileSync/kernel-side
  `runProgramToCompletion` path entirely unrelated to `MessageChannel`?
  not yet distinguished).

**Concrete next step, more specific than before:** get root/CAP_SYS_PTRACE
(or run inside a container/VM where `ptrace_scope` can be relaxed, or
`perf_event_paranoid` allows a non-root profile) so `strace`/`perf` can
actually sample the pinned thread - or, alternatively, pursue the CDP
`Profiler.start()`/`.stop()` route directly against the specific worker's
own DevTools target (requires talking raw CDP, since Chromium was
launched with `--remote-debugging-pipe` rather than a discoverable
`--remote-debugging-port`, and Playwright's own high-level `Worker`
object has no built-in CPU-profile method) - either would finally show
the actual function/loop responsible instead of continuing to infer it
from process-level CPU/thread-state evidence alone.

### Follow-up session: ported a real fix from a sibling implementation, confirmed it doesn't touch THIS hang, then found what looks like the actual root cause

**Found a real, production WebContainer implementation
(`~/workspace/duck/vivari`, `@vivari/core` - a separate project on this
same machine, an open-source WebContainer this project's own kernel/
worker/preview design was modeled on from the start) that hit this EXACT
bug already**, against this exact library. Its
`packages/runtime/node/lib/worker_threads.js` has a comment describing
our symptom almost word for word: *"rolldown's wasm binding
(@napi-rs/wasm-runtime, via Vite 8) spawns its wasi worker, hands it a
channel, and awaits the reply. The reply was on its way; the process was
not there to receive it."* Its fix: no debounce at all - `port.ref()`/
`.unref()` wired directly and immediately to its event loop's real
hold-counter, plus a `duringInternalSetup` guard so the runtime's OWN
internal plumbing ports never accidentally count as a guest hold (their
own postmortem: a naive full replacement "held a guest loop open on a
port the guest had never heard of: every worker spawn hung, one layer
below anything a guest could see" - this project's own two prior
freezes, at two different points, are at least superficially the same
SHAPE of bug).

**Ported the direct-wiring half of this** (`workers/process/
worker.ts`'s `wrapRefPort`): dropped `REF_PORT_DEBOUNCE_MS`/the release
timer entirely, `.ref()`/`.unref()` now call `eventLoop.ref()`/`unref()`
immediately and unconditionally, matching Vivari's own proven-live
shape as closely as this codebase's own `eventLoop` allows. (The
`duringInternalSetup`-style guard was NOT ported - see below for why a
project-wide source read showed it doesn't apply verbatim here.)
Typechecked clean, all 584 tests still passing, rebuilt.

**Before re-testing live, worked out that this fix cannot be what's
causing the CURRENT observed hang, and confirmed it by testing anyway.**
`workers/process/syncExecClient.ts`'s `callSyncExec` blocks via a real
`Atomics.wait` (not a busy spin) - so the calling (vite) process
worker is genuinely, harmlessly parked while the kernel runs the pnpm
install. And @emnapi/core's own ref/unref-based keep-alive signal is
only reachable AFTER something `require()`s the downloaded WASM
binding - which hasn't happened yet at the "Downloading..." point where
this session's stall occurs. So whatever hangs here cannot be the
ref/unref mechanism this fix targets at all. Re-ran the full live demo
anyway to confirm empirically rather than rely on the reasoning alone:
**same result as before the fix** - stall at the same point, same
oscillating-hot-then-idle CPU pattern on one Dedicated Worker thread
(started ~90s in this time, ran continuously hot for ~2m10s, then a
brief idle blip, hot again - not periodic, no forward progress in
output). Confirms: **this specific fix is a real improvement (worth
keeping, matches a proven design) but does not fix the currently-
observed stall.**

Also confirmed by direct source read, not just reasoning: the OTHER two
`new MessageChannel()` call sites in this codebase
(`workers/kernel/processClient.ts`, backing the sync-fs and sync-exec
channel grants) run in the **kernel worker**, a separate bundled script
that never calls the **process worker's** own `boot()` - the only place
the wrapped global override is installed. So Vivari's specific
"internal plumbing port counted as a guest hold" hazard doesn't have an
obvious matching instance in this codebase's `MessageChannel` usage
specifically (this project's own internal worker-to-worker plumbing for
`worker_threads.Worker` uses a real `Worker` object directly, not a
`MessageChannel`/`MessagePort` pair the way Vivari's design does - a
different architecture that doesn't share this exact contamination
path, though it may have its own, not yet identified).

**Then, guided by "if it's not the ref/unref mechanism, what IS active
at this exact point," built a fast isolated test and found what looks
like the real root cause: installing into a directory with NO
`package.json` throws a real npm error in this runtime, always, and
real rolldown's own fallback code does exactly that.**

Built a minimal test page (`main.isolated-test.ts` + `isolated-test.html`,
temporary, not committed, since deleted) that boots dwc, loads vendored
npm, and calls ONLY `execFileSync('pnpm', ['i',
'@rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi'])` - no vite, no create-vite, nothing
concurrent. Result, run twice for reproducibility: **not a hang** -
fails FAST (2.2-4.6s) both times with `npm error Tracker "idealTree"
already exists`, a real npm/npmlog internal error (calling
`log.newGroup('idealTree')` a second time before the first is closed).

Narrowed further, each a fresh isolated run:
- **Not pnpm-shim-specific**: calling `execFileSync('npm', ['install',
  ...])` directly (bypassing `/bin/pnpm.js` entirely) fails the exact
  same way.
- **Not package-specific**: swapping the target package for `left-pad`
  (this project's own very first, most-exercised install target,
  verified working correctly dozens of times across this whole project's
  history) fails the SAME way, with the SAME error.
- **Not execFileSync/sync-exec-bridge-specific**: the NORMAL async
  `dwc.process.spawn("/bin/npm.js", {argv: ["install", "left-pad", ...]})`
  path (used successfully throughout this entire project) ALSO fails
  the same way, given the same conditions.
- **The actual distinguishing variable, found by elimination**: `cwd`.
  Installing `left-pad` into `/proj` (a directory this test pre-created
  with a minimal `package.json`) **succeeds cleanly, exit 0** - identical
  command, identical package, only the cwd's own contents differ (a
  `package.json` present vs. absent).
- **Confirmed this is NOT how real, host-machine npm behaves**: the
  exact same command (`npm install left-pad --no-save --no-audit
  --no-fund --loglevel=warn`), run for real via this session's own
  shell in a genuinely empty, package.json-less scratch directory on
  the actual host machine (`npm 11.9.0`/`node v24.14.0`, both real,
  unrelated to this sandbox) - `added 1 package in 2s`, exit 0, no error
  at all. **This project's own runtime is the only place this specific
  scenario throws** - a real, previously-undiscovered gap, not
  documented real npm behavior this runtime happens to be faithfully
  reproducing.
- **Confirmed real rolldown's own fallback code hits exactly this
  scenario, every time, by design**: read the actual fallback source
  directly (`npm pack rolldown@1.2.7` on the host,
  `dist/shared/binding-*.mjs`'s `require_webcontainer_fallback`) -
  `baseDir` is a freshly `mkdirSync(..., {recursive:true})`'d directory
  (`/tmp/rolldown-<version>`) with **no package.json ever written to
  it**, and `execFileSync("pnpm", ["i", bindingPkg], {cwd: baseDir,
  stdio: "inherit"})` is called completely unguarded - **no try/catch
  anywhere around it**. This is a precise, exact match for the
  bug just isolated.

**CORRECTION, same session, immediately after writing the above: this
was a red herring - narrowed further and retracted as the root-cause
candidate.** The very next isolated test filled in a missing control
that the reasoning above skipped past: a real, non-root, package.json-
less directory (`/emptydir`, freshly `mkdir`'d, nothing else touched
it) - **installs cleanly, exit 0, no error at all.** So "no
`package.json`" was never the actual distinguishing variable; the
original failing test happened to use `cwd: "/"` (the literal VFS
root) specifically, and root-ness, not package.json presence, is what
triggers it. Tested this precisely: `cwd:
"/tmp/rolldown-1.2.7"` - **exactly** the `baseDir` real rolldown's own
fallback source computes (`` `/tmp/rolldown-${version}` ``, confirmed
directly from `npm pack rolldown@1.2.7`'s actual source, same file
already read above) - **also installs cleanly, exit 0.**

**So this bug is real (installing at the literal VFS root throws `npm
error Tracker "idealTree" already exists`, confirmed not to be genuine
npm behavior - real npm 10.9.2 as a genuine separate host process,
AND even the same "require npm-cli.js in-process with mutated argv"
technique run in plain host Node with no sandbox at all, both handle a
root-equivalent package.json-less cwd fine) - but it is NOT what real
rolldown's own fallback code would ever hit, since rolldown never
installs at the literal root. It's a separate, narrower, genuinely
worth-fixing gap (something in this runtime's own VFS/fs emulation
behaves differently at the root path specifically vs. any other
directory, in a way that trips npm's own per-process idealTree tracker
bookkeeping) - but chasing it further is NOT the way to unblock the
vite/rolldown investigation. Retracting the "leading root-cause
candidate" claim and the priority-ordered next-steps list that followed
it in the same session - they were reasoning from an incomplete control
group (root vs. non-root was never actually isolated from
has-package.json vs. doesn't) and turned out to point at the wrong
thing once that gap was closed.

**Where this actually leaves item 8:** back to the CPU-pinned-worker-
thread / livelock evidence from earlier in this session (the
`ptrace`/`perf`-permission-blocked profiling attempt) as the genuine
next lead - see "Concrete next steps" further up this section for that.
The VFS-root npm bug is worth a note for whoever eventually works on
general npm/VFS-root robustness, but it's off the critical path for
`npm run dev`'s own hang specifically.

### Concrete next steps, in order

1. **Before anything else: re-run the real end-to-end demo against the
   current code, polling tab responsiveness every ~10s** (not a blind
   wait — that's the only reason the second freeze's different location
   was ever caught). Three possible outcomes:
   - It freezes again → the bug is real and still unfound; go to step 2.
   - It doesn't freeze but still exits early without reaching `Local:` →
     progress, but the ref-counting fix isn't sufficient by itself; look
     at what's happening right at/after wherever it now gets to.
   - It reaches `Local:` and the preview actually renders → **this closes
     out items 1, 2, 3, and 7 in this file all at once** — real npm
     install, real npm create, and a real running Vite dev server
     previewed live, for the first time. Still fix `waitForMarker()`
     (found in step 2 of the diagnostic chain above) regardless, and
     separately verify HMR (item 4) still hasn't been addressed at all.
2. **If it freezes again: grow the isolated test toward the real
   pipeline incrementally, rather than jumping straight back to the full
   thing.** The isolated test proved the override alone is fine; the
   real pipeline combination isn't. Useful intermediate steps, cheapest
   first: (a) the isolated test's `MessageChannel` stress, but running
   *concurrently* with a real blocking `execFileSync` call (since the
   second freeze happened right around that step); (b) requiring the
   real WASI binding module (`rolldown-binding.wasi.cjs`) and calling a
   *different* native async method than `resolveId` on a builtin plugin,
   to see if the freeze is specific to that one call or general to any
   native async dispatch; (c) only once one of these reproduces a freeze
   should live end-to-end testing resume.
3. Independent of all of the above: fix `waitForMarker()` regardless (see
   step 2 of the diagnostic chain) so a future run that fails differently
   still surfaces clearly instead of silently reaching a preview that was
   never going to work.

### Diagnostic techniques learned this session (worth reusing, not
re-discovering)

- **`read_console_messages` (browser automation) only reliably captures
  the main page thread's console.** `console.log()` calls from inside a
  nested Worker (the kernel worker, a process worker, etc.) do fire, but
  don't show up through that tool — confirmed by adding logging that
  never appeared no matter how it was searched for, until it was rerouted
  through the existing `cp-event` (`kind: "stdout"`/`"stderr"`) relay
  mechanism (`worker.postMessage({ type: "cp-event", payload: { id, kind:
  "stderr", chunk: ... } })`, using the same request `id` a spawn is
  already tracking, or `onEvent("stderr", { chunk }, "")` inside
  `processClient.ts` functions that already have an `onEvent` in scope) —
  at which point it appeared immediately as ordinary stdout/stderr on
  whatever host-visible process was already being piped.
- **The vendored guest `console.log()` (`worker.ts`) stringifies via
  `args.map(String).join(" ")`** — passing an object logs the useless
  `[object Object]`. Always `JSON.stringify()` first when relaying trace
  data through it or through the `cp-event` stderr channel above.
- **`//# sourceURL=dwc://module<path>` was added to `moduleLoader.ts`'s
  `new Function` compilation this session** (committed separately,
  `4d0f2b6`, kept) — every guest stack trace now names the real vendored
  file instead of `eval at loadModule (...), <anonymous>:N:M`. This is
  what turned an unattributable `process.exit(0)` call into an
  immediately actionable `npm/lib/cli/exit-handler.js:171`, and should
  make every future guest-code debugging session in this runtime faster.
- **A single-file isolated repro is much faster than the full cycle** for
  testing one hypothesis at a time: `dwc.fs.writeFile('/bin/foo.js',
  script)` then `dwc.process.spawn('/bin/foo.js', { argv: [], cwd: '/' })`
  runs in well under a second, versus several real minutes for a fresh
  `npm create vite` → `npm install` → `npm run dev` cycle. This is how
  BOTH the "basic worker_threads+sync-fs is fine" ruling-out (step 5) AND
  the final "the override alone is fine in isolation" finding were
  produced cheaply. Also: `dwc.process.spawn` (the **host-facing** API)
  does not support the `command === "node"` + script-argv special case
  guest-side `child_process.spawn()`/shell dispatch gets via
  `resolveEntryPoint` — always give it a real, existing file path as
  `command` directly, not `"node"` as the command with the script as an
  arg.
- **Patching a real npm/dependency file directly inside the guest VFS**
  (read via `dwc.fs.readFile`, string-`replace()` *in the browser* to
  avoid ever pulling a large file through the agent's own context or
  hitting the browser tool's base64/cookie-like-data output filter, then
  `dwc.fs.writeFile` back) is a fast way to add temporary tracing to real
  vendored dependency code (npm itself, `@npmcli/run-script`,
  `@npmcli/promise-spawn`, real vite's own `dist/node/chunks/node.js`,
  real rolldown's `dist/shared/binding-*.mjs`) without needing a local
  checkout — `npm pack <pkg>@<version>` into a scratch directory first
  gives the exact same source to diff against/copy exact patch text from.
  These VFS patches don't persist across a real npm reinstall (this
  demo's own `npm create vite` reinstalls `/my-app` fresh on every page
  reload), so they're inherently throwaway and need no cleanup.
- **When a live test might freeze the tab: poll responsiveness on a short
  interval (~10s) rather than waiting blindly for the outcome.** This is
  the only reason the second fix attempt's freeze was caught at a
  *different, informative* location instead of just "it froze again,
  somewhere" — a `javascript_exec` call as simple as
  `document.readyState` timing out after 45s ("the renderer may be
  frozen or unresponsive") is the tell; when it happens, close the tab
  (don't keep retrying against a frozen one) and start a fresh one for
  the next attempt.

### FINAL ROOT CAUSE — found and fixed (latest session, picks up right after the "corrected/retracted VFS-root npm bug" entry above)

**Read this section first if picking this up on a new device — it
supersedes the ref-counting theory above as the explanation for the
actual hang, though the ref-counting rewrite itself is a real, separate
improvement that's still correct and still in the tree.**

**Method: added a real, permanent-for-the-session diagnostic technique -
patching the REAL, installed dependency files at runtime, not just this
project's own source** - both `main.ts` (temporarily, since reverted -
see "how this was found" below for the general technique, reusable any
time this project's own source isn't the suspect) and, for the real fix,
`workers/workerThreads/worker.ts` (permanently, the actual bug was here).
Confirmed the debounced ref/unref fix from the entry above doesn't touch
the currently-observed hang (reasoned first - `Atomics.wait` in
`syncExecClient.ts` proves the caller is genuinely, harmlessly blocked,
and nothing has `require()`'d the WASM binding yet at the "Downloading…"
point where this session's stall occurred - then confirmed live: same
stall, same oscillating-CPU pattern, with the fix in place). **Ported
Vivari's own proven-working direct (non-debounced) ref/unref design
anyway** (a real, separate sibling WebContainer implementation at
`~/workspace/duck/vivari` that hit this exact class of bug against this
exact library before - see its `packages/runtime/node/lib/
worker_threads.js`) - dropped `REF_PORT_DEBOUNCE_MS` entirely,
`workers/process/worker.ts`'s `wrapRefPort` now wires `.ref()`/`.unref()`
straight to `eventLoop.ref()`/`unref()`. Real improvement, kept, but (as
predicted) doesn't fix the hang below - they're unrelated bugs.

**How this was found: instrumented the REAL execution path directly,
live, in the actual full pipeline - not guesswork.** Built a reusable
technique: a `patchRolldownFallback()` helper added temporarily to
`main.ts` that walks the real, installed dependency tree (`dwc.fs.readdir`
+ `dwc.fs.stat` recursively) and rewrites specific call sites in place
(`dwc.fs.writeFile` back) with `console.error`-based before/after/catch
timing markers - then re-runs the real `npm create vite` → `npm install`
→ `npm run dev` cycle and watches the real timestamps. Three rounds,
each based on what the previous round proved:

1. **Wrapped `execFileSync("pnpm", …)` itself** (in the real installed
   `rolldown/dist/shared/binding-*.mjs`) - proved it returns cleanly
   (confirmed independently too: isolated `execFileSync` tests, with
   rolldown's own real `cwd` - `/tmp/rolldown-<version>` - always
   succeeded; the earlier same-session "VFS-root npm bug" finding was
   real but a red herring, retracted above, since rolldown never
   actually installs at the VFS root).
2. **Wrapped the native `resolveId()` dispatch itself**
   (`return await callablePlugin[key](...args)` inside
   `makeBuiltinPluginCallable`'s `wrappedHook`, in
   `rolldown/dist/shared/normalize-string-or-regex-*.mjs`) - confirmed,
   yet again, that this specific call is where execution stops: "before
   native call key=resolveId" always printed, "RETURNED" never did,
   across every attempt up to this point.
3. **Patched the REAL, freshly-downloaded `wasi-worker.mjs` itself**
   (a completely separate tree, `/tmp/rolldown-<version>/node_modules/
   @rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi/wasi-worker.mjs` - only created by
   execFileSync mid-run, never reachable by `main.ts`'s own `/my-app`
   walk, so this needed patching it right after `execFileSync` returns,
   from within the SAME guest code, using the real `fs`/`baseDir`
   already in that function's own closure) - wrapped its own
   `globalThis.onmessage = function (e) { handler.handle(e); };` with
   before/after logging.

**That third patch showed the real message DID arrive and the listener
DID attach** (`parentPort.on("message", …)` fired, buffered messages
flushed correctly) **but nothing downstream of that ever ran again -
not even a bare, independent, native `Promise.resolve().then(cb)` probe
registered at that exact point ever fired.** That's the tell: a native
microtask *always* fires once the current synchronous stack unwinds,
unless that stack never actually unwinds - meaning something in the
supposedly-trivial remaining top-level code of `wasi-worker.mjs` (after
`parentPort.on(...)`, before `globalThis.onmessage = ...`) was
genuinely, synchronously never returning.

**Root cause, precisely:** `wasi-worker.mjs`'s own top-level code (real,
unmodified `@napi-rs/wasm-runtime`-generated code) does, in order:

```js
if (parentPort) {
  parentPort.on("message", (data) => { globalThis.onmessage({ data }); });
}
Object.assign(globalThis, {
  self: globalThis, require, Worker, importScripts,
  postMessage: function (msg) { if (parentPort) { parentPort.postMessage(msg); } },
});
// ... (trivial setup) ...
globalThis.onmessage = function (e) { handler.handle(e); };
```

This `Object.assign` call **legitimately overrides `globalThis.postMessage`**
(real Node's own `worker_threads` convention: wire a bare top-level
`postMessage` to `parentPort`, for code written against a Web-Worker-
shaped API) - a completely normal, expected thing for Node-emulating
vendored code to do, not a bug in wasi-worker.mjs at all. But this
project's OWN `workers/workerThreads/worker.ts` (before this fix) had
`parentPort.postMessage: (value, transferList) => self.postMessage(value,
transferList ?? [])` - calling the **bare, live** `self.postMessage`
reference, not one captured before any guest code could run. The instant
anything calls `self.postMessage(...)` after that `Object.assign` has
run, it recurses forever: `self.postMessage` (now the guest's own
wrapper) → `parentPort.postMessage` (this project's own code) →
`self.postMessage` (the guest's wrapper again, unchanged) → … - a
genuine, silent, synchronous infinite loop with no error, no stack
overflow message reaching any caller (the recursion happens entirely
inside plain function calls, never crossing a Promise/task boundary
where a stack-overflow RangeError would have anywhere to surface to).
**This is the exact same class of bug this codebase has fixed multiple
times before for its OWN overrides** (`eventLoop.ts`'s own
`nativeSetTimeout`/`nativeMessageChannel`, `workers/process/worker.ts`'s
own `nativeMessageChannel`) **- just never caught for `postMessage`,
because this is the one case where GUEST code (not this project's own
`Object.assign(self, {...})` calls) does the overriding.**

**Fix**: `workers/workerThreads/worker.ts` now captures
`const nativePostMessage = self.postMessage.bind(self)` at module load,
before any guest code can run (same pattern, same precaution, as the
existing `nativeSetTimeout`/`nativeMessageChannel` precedents elsewhere
in this codebase) - `parentPort.postMessage()` and the `BOOT_ERROR_TAG`
failure-reporting path both use this captured reference instead of the
live, guest-shadowable `self.postMessage`. Typechecked clean, all 584
tests still passing, rebuilt.

**Verified live, twice, with full diagnostic instrumentation still in
place (before stripping it) - the fix works:** the native `resolveId()`
call that had NEVER ONCE returned across this entire multi-session
investigation now **completes successfully** ("native call RETURNED
key=resolveId"), the WASI worker's own `handle()` call returns cleanly
for both `'load'` and `'start'` message types, and multiple worker
threads spin up, load, and complete in sequence - the exact chain item
8's own diagnostic trail (steps 6-9 above) originally traced as the
hang point, now fully unblocked. All temporary diagnostic instrumentation
(in `main.ts`, `worker.ts`, `runtime/builtins/worker_threads.ts`) has
been stripped back out - `main.ts` and `runtime/builtins/worker_threads.ts`
are back to their original committed state (`git checkout`'d), and
`workers/workerThreads/worker.ts` keeps only the real fix (the
`nativePostMessage` capture, the deferred-microtask message flush from
the ref-counting entry above, and `dispatchToListener`'s per-listener
try/catch) - no debug logging left behind.

**Where it stops now - real vite/rolldown gets much further, into a
new, much smaller, unrelated bug:** past `resolveId()`, past
`buildStart()`, into Vite's own real dependency-scan logic, which fails
with:

```
(!) Failed to run dependency scan. Skipping dependency pre-bundling.
TypeError: Expected pattern to be a non-empty string
    at picomatch (dwc://module/my-app/node_modules/picomatch/lib/picomatch.js:61:11)
```

Vite's own scanner catches this and logs "Skipping dependency
pre-bundling" rather than crashing - real Vite resilience, matching its
own documented graceful-degradation behavior for a failed pre-bundling
scan - so the process does NOT hang here; it continues. What happens
after that was not yet observed to conclusion: the last live run reached
this exact point and then produced a genuinely huge (~67MB) stderr chunk
(a base64-embedded `data:` URL as part of a stack trace, flowing through
this test's own console-log-based observation pipe) that overloaded the
Playwright driver's own IPC pipe ("write data discarded, use flow
control to avoid losing data") and ultimately crashed the renderer
(confirmed via `ps`: a zombie chrome-headless-shell process with 33+
minutes of accumulated CPU time) - **this is a testing-harness artifact,
not a hang in the app** (same class of pitfall this doc's own
"Diagnostic techniques" section already warns about: "huge single
console.log calls choke an automated console reader... don't buffer
~150MB... read in small slices instead").

**Concrete next steps, in order, for whoever picks this up:**
1. Root-cause the `picomatch` `TypeError: Expected pattern to be a
   non-empty string` itself - likely some config value (an ignore
   pattern, an include/exclude glob) that's empty/undefined in this
   sandboxed environment where real Node would have a real, non-empty
   default (a `path`/`cwd`-derived value computed differently here,
   perhaps). Trace via the same "patch the real installed file with
   before/after logging" technique documented above, applied to
   whatever real Vite/rolldown code calls into `getPartialMatcher`/
   `picomatch` during its dependency-scan step.
2. Re-run the full live demo **without** heavy diagnostic
   instrumentation this time (the real fix needs no more proving) and
   with the test harness's OWN console-capture made resilient to large
   output specifically around this step - e.g. truncate any single
   captured console message hard (a few KB) before it ever reaches the
   host-side pipe, not just when logging it, since the crash this
   session hit was in the CAPTURE path itself, not just in what got
   displayed afterward.
3. If the picomatch issue is fixed (or shown to be harmless/skippable,
   matching Vite's own "Skipping dependency pre-bundling" resilience)
   and the demo reaches the real `Local:` ready banner with the preview
   iframe actually rendering the dev server's page, **this closes out
   the ENTIRE multi-session item 7/8 investigation** - real npm install,
   real npm create, and a real running Vite dev server (via real
   rolldown/WASI) previewed live, all working end-to-end, for the first
   time in this project's history. Still separately verify HMR (item 4)
   afterward - a working `vite dev` server is not the same as
   live-reload-on-edit, which remains its own, entirely unstarted
   question.

## 9. MAJOR MILESTONE — real Vite dev server serves a real HTTP 200 response for the first time ever; new frontier found, a non-deterministic WASM trap right after

**Update, picking item 8 back up on yet another device, right after step
1/3 above: the `picomatch` bug turned out to be a non-blocker (matches
step 3's own "or shown to be harmless" clause) - the dependency scan
failure is genuinely swallowed, exactly as Vite's own resilience is
supposed to work, and the server goes on to bind and print its own real
ready banner:**

```
[vite] connected.

  VITE v8.2.2  ready in ~17s

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

Confirmed via a direct, isolated repro (spawn `/my-app/node_modules/
vite/bin/vite.js` directly, bypassing npm/the shell dispatch, same
technique as the rest of this investigation) - **and then confirmed the
actual thing this whole file has been chasing since item 2: a real
`dwc.preview.fetch(5173, '/')` call from the host page returns a real,
successful HTTP response - `{ status: 200, statusMessage, headers, body
}` - from the real, running Vite dev server, for the first time in this
project's entire history.** Reproduced twice, independently, in two
separate fresh spawns.

**But the server doesn't stay up: somewhere between ~0ms and ~1s after
that first successful response, the WHOLE PROCESS crashes with a genuine
WASM-level trap** - `worker sent an error! Uncaught RuntimeError:
unreachable` in one run, `Uncaught RuntimeError: operation does not
support unaligned accesses` in another, for the exact same test repeated
back-to-back. **The trap TYPE varies between otherwise-identical runs -
that's the important tell.** A deterministic logic bug in the Rust/WASM
code would trap the same way every time; a trap type that changes run to
run, for the same inputs, is the classic signature of memory corruption
or a data race - something writing to (or reading from) WASM linear
memory at a moment or in a shape the code didn't expect, so the SPECIFIC
invariant that ends up violated depends on the exact interleaving/memory
state at the time, not just the code path taken.

**Isolated and confirmed request-triggered, not a background timer:**
spawned fresh, waited 30+ seconds with zero requests made - stayed
completely stable, zero crash, zero stderr. Only once an actual
`dwc.preview.fetch()` call reaches the server does the crash follow,
within about a second. (The `picomatch`/tinyglobby dependency-scan code
patched with tracing in step 1 above never fired in either crash run -
confirmed by checking the patched file was still in place afterward -
so whatever's crashing is a DIFFERENT code path than the scan; that
tracing can be removed/ignored by whoever picks this up next, it's not
wired to this bug.)

**Leading hypothesis (not yet confirmed - needs its own investigation):**
this is very likely connected to the `resolveId()`/`parentPort.
postMessage` fix earlier in this same item - that fix is what first let
rolldown's own multi-threaded WASI code path actually run to completion
("multiple worker threads spin up, load, and complete in sequence," per
that entry) instead of hanging forever before ever reaching real,
concurrent WASM execution. A real HTTP request against a real Vite dev
server backed by rolldown very plausibly dispatches work across more than
one of those threads (transform requests, module resolution, etc., all
sharing the same WASM linear memory via `SharedArrayBuffer` under the
`wasi-threads` model this project's own `worker_threads.Worker`
implementation backs). If there's a race or a synchronization gap
somewhere in how this runtime bridges that shared memory between threads
(as opposed to real Node/libuv's own battle-tested thread-safety
guarantees for the equivalent native addon), this exact "different trap
each time, only on real concurrent work, never at idle" symptom is
what you'd expect to see. Not confirmed - genuinely the next thing to dig
into, not a guess dressed up as a finding.

**Update, same session, continuing the "concrete next steps" above -
step 1 done (dead end, confirmed not assumed), step 2 done (request
variety tested directly, narrows the bug precisely), one new bug found
along the way:**

**Step 1 - DWARF debug info: confirmed absent, not just assumed.**
Installed `wabt` (`npm install wabt`, the same package this project
already used once before for a hand-compiled WAT test module - see
item 3's own `node:wasi` work) and ran `wasm-objdump -h` on the real,
installed `.wasm` binary. Section list: `Type`, `Import`, `Function`,
`Table`, `Global`, `Export`, `Start`, `Elem`, `DataCount`, `Code`,
`Data`, and exactly one `Custom` section - `"target_features"`. **No
`.debug_info`/`.debug_line`/etc. at all** - a real, stripped production
release build (10.8MB; an unstripped debug build of a bundler this size
would typically be far larger). This path is a genuine dead end, not
just unexplored - there is no DWARF for any tool to resolve a trap
address against.

**Step 2 - request variety: the crash is real, reproducible, and
*specific to native transform work*, not "any real request."** Ran
three separate fresh spawns, one request type each, all against a real,
live vite/rolldown dev server:

- `GET /favicon.svg` (a real static asset the vanilla template ships,
  served straight off disk with no rolldown transform involved at all) -
  **does NOT crash the process.** Instead hits a different, much
  smaller, genuinely fixable bug: `vite Internal server error: Cannot
  read properties of undefined (reading 'toUTCString')` at a `toHeaders`
  call (inside vite's own static-file-serving header synthesis, real
  ESM-loaded vite code) - returned as a clean HTTP 500, server stays up
  and serves further requests fine afterward. This is almost certainly a
  missing/undefined value (most likely a file `mtime`) where vite's own
  static-serving code expects a real `Date`-shaped value to call
  `.toUTCString()` on for a `Last-Modified`-style header - this
  runtime's own fs-stat emulation is the prime suspect, not vite/
  rolldown. **A real, separate, much easier bug - worth fixing on its
  own, unrelated to the WASM crash.**
- `GET /` (the HTML entry, needs HTML parsing + entry-script resolution
  + rolldown's own native `transform()`/`resolveId()` for the entry
  module) - **crashes**, same as item 9's own original finding:
  `RuntimeError: unreachable`.
- `GET /src/main.js` (a plain real JS module - no HTML involved at all,
  but STILL needs rolldown's own native `transform()` to process it) -
  **also crashes**, this time `RuntimeError: operation does not support
  unaligned accesses` - a *different* trap type than the `/` run, for a
  *different* request, reconfirming the "trap type varies, not
  deterministic" signature from the original finding.

**This precisely narrows the bug: it's not "any real HTTP request," and
it's not HTML-specific either - it's specifically any request that
requires rolldown's own native transform/resolve machinery to actually
run**, vs. a plain static-file read (no native code touched at all),
which is completely safe. Strengthens the leading hypothesis from the
original finding (a race/memory-safety issue in this runtime's own
shared-WASM-memory bridging across the real worker threads doing that
native work) rather than weakening it - every request that reproduces
the crash is one that dispatches real work into that native path; the
one that doesn't, doesn't.

**New, separate robustness bug found while testing this: a
`dwc.preview.fetch()` call whose underlying process crashes mid-request
never rejects - it hangs forever.** Requesting `/src/main.js` this way,
the call was still pending when the browser tooling's own 45-second
timeout fired ("the renderer may be frozen or unresponsive"; the tab
itself was fine afterward, just that one call never settled). The
kernel/`netRelay`/preview-relay path has no handling today for "the
worker serving this connection just terminated" - a caller has no way
to know the request will never complete short of an external timeout of
their own. Worth fixing independently of the WASM crash itself, since
even a fully-working single-threaded fallback (if step 3 below pans out)
would still leave a REAL failure (a script error, an actual crash for
some other reason) hanging a caller forever today.

**Update, same session: step 3 (force single-threaded) tested directly -
crash SURVIVES, refuting the leading hypothesis as originally stated.**

Confirmed via `strings` on the real `.wasm` binary that rolldown genuinely
ships with `rayon`/`rayon-core` (real Rust data-parallelism), and the
binary literally contains the env var names it reads: `RAYON_NUM_THREADS`,
`RAYON_RS_NUM_CPUS`. Separately, `rolldown-binding.wasi.cjs` itself reads
`NAPI_RS_ASYNC_WORK_POOL_SIZE` (falling back to `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE`,
defaulting to 4) to size the emnapi async-work-dispatch worker pool - a
real, distinct knob from rayon's own, each controlling a different kind of
internal parallelism.

Spawned a fresh `vite` process directly (`dwc.process.spawn(".../vite.js",
{cwd: "/my-app", env: {RAYON_NUM_THREADS: "1", NAPI_RS_ASYNC_WORK_POOL_SIZE:
"1"}})`, bypassing npm dispatch same as the original milestone repro) with
both knobs forced to their minimum, confirmed it reached `VITE ... ready`
normally, then issued the same repeated `/` and `/src/main.js` requests
that reliably crash the default (unconstrained) instance.

**The crash still happened, on the very first native-transform-requiring
request, with the trap type still varying run to run** (`operation does
not support unaligned accesses` this run, vs `unreachable` in the
unconstrained runs) - forcing both documented thread-count knobs to 1 did
NOT make the crash disappear.

This refutes the *original form* of the race-condition hypothesis (a race
among *multiple* rayon workers, or among *multiple* async-work-pool
workers). It does NOT fully close the door on threading as the cause,
because `asyncWorkPoolSize` is read as `threadsSizeFromEnv > 0 ? that : 4`
- there is no way to request pool size 0 through this knob, so even this
"minimum" run still had two real threads touching the shared
`WebAssembly.Memory`: the main WASI thread plus the one always-present
pool worker. A race specifically between those two (rather than among
several peers) remains untested and can't be ruled out this way.

That said, `operation does not support unaligned accesses` is specifically
the trap V8 throws for a misaligned *atomic* WASM instruction (ordinary
non-atomic loads/stores don't trap on misalignment in wasm32) - and
emnapi's synchronous-looking cross-thread dispatch (the same
`Atomics.wait`/`notify`-style bridging item 8's own `postMessage` fix
unblocked) is exactly the kind of code that issues atomic ops against
computed addresses in shared memory. Combined with the trap type varying
run to run on otherwise-identical requests, the more precise reading now
is: **something is writing through a bad/stale pointer into the shared
linear memory buffer**, and depending on what that clobbers, execution
either hits a Rust `unreachable!()`/panic path or a misaligned atomic
access soon after. That pointer bug doesn't have to be a race between
independent threads racing for the same resource - it's just as
consistent with a bug in this project's OWN WASI host-function shims (the
functions implementing `fd_write`/`fd_read`/`path_open`/etc., which write
into and read out of the guest's linear memory at computed offsets on
every real file-touching call) miscomputing an address or a length
somewhere, corrupting memory adjacent to whatever rolldown/rayon then
reads next. This fits the "only native-transform/resolve requests crash"
finding just as well as the multi-thread-race hypothesis did (those are
exactly the requests that make real WASI file-read syscalls), and doesn't
require a race at all - worth checking this project's own WASI syscall
implementations for exactly this class of bug before spending further
effort on the threading angle.

**Update, same session: pushed the single-threading test further by
patching the loader directly (guest VFS, ephemeral) rather than relying
on env vars - the "always-present pool worker" framing above was itself
still not the whole picture.**

Found the real, on-disk location of the WASI binding this runtime
actually loads (not under `/my-app/node_modules` at all - rolldown's own
WebContainer-detection fallback installs it lazily on first use, into
`/tmp/rolldown-1.2.8/node_modules/@rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi/`, found
by a recursive filename search from `/` after `@rolldown/binding-wasm32-
wasi` came up missing everywhere under the project directory itself).
Patched `rolldown-binding.wasi.cjs`'s `asyncWorkPoolSize` computation
in-place (guest VFS write, same technique as the earlier tinyglobby
tracing patch) from the env-var-driven expression down to a hardcoded
`asyncWorkPoolSize: 0`, respawned vite fresh so it re-reads the patched
file, and re-ran the same crashing requests. **The crash still happened
identically** (same `RuntimeError: unreachable` / `operation does not
support unaligned accesses` pattern).

To confirm this patch actually achieved zero pool workers (rather than
`instantiateNapiModuleSync` silently flooring `0` back up to some
minimum the way the env-var path floors to 4), added a one-line
`console.error` trace at the top of the loader's own `onCreateWorker()`
callback and re-ran. **`onCreateWorker` still fired - twice - even with
`asyncWorkPoolSize: 0` and `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1` both set.** This means
`asyncWorkPoolSize` does NOT govern all real-thread creation the way its
name suggests - something else (most plausibly: real WASI `thread-spawn`
calls issued on demand by rayon/rolldown's own Rust code, serviced
through `onCreateWorker`'s `reuseWorker: true` pooling regardless of the
async-dispatch pool's own configured size) unconditionally creates at
least 2 real worker threads, and neither of the two knobs tested (env
vars or this direct patch) can suppress that. A genuinely single-
threaded, zero-extra-real-thread run of this WASM module does not appear
to be reachable through anything exposed at the JS loader level.

**Net result of the whole threading investigation, stated precisely:**
every configuration tried - default (pool defaults to 4, rayon
unconstrained), pool forced to 1 via env var, and pool patched to 0
directly in the loader (which still produced 2 real worker threads) -
crashes identically, with the trap type still varying run to run in
every case. This does NOT prove the bug is thread-count-independent
(true 0-extra-thread execution was never actually achieved, so a race
specific to those 2 always-created threads remains technically
possible), but it does mean **the crash cannot be described as "goes
away below N threads" for any N reachable from the JS side** - so
"reduce the thread count" is not a viable workaround path with the tools
available here, and further threading-focused effort would need to
intercept the Rust-level `wasi_thread_spawn` import itself (well beyond
what's practical to patch from the guest VFS). Combined with the earlier
observation that `operation does not support unaligned accesses` is
specifically an atomic-instruction trap and the trap type varies run to
run, a memory-corruption bug (write through a bad/stale pointer,
surfacing differently depending what it clobbers) remains the best
overall explanation - whether that pointer bug originates from a genuine
2-thread race that survives every mitigation tried, or from something
that would corrupt memory even on one thread, is still open.

**Concrete next steps, in order:**
1. **Audit this project's own WASI host-function shims** (`fd_write`/
   `fd_read`/`path_open`/`fd_seek`/etc. - wherever they read a
   pointer+length pair out of the guest's `WebAssembly.Memory` and write
   into or read out of it) for an address/length computation bug,
   focusing on the real file-read path a transform/resolve call actually
   exercises - since that's the exact code shared by every request type
   that crashes and absent from the one (`/favicon.svg`) that doesn't
   reach rolldown's native code at all. Note: the actual pointer/iovec
   math here is NOT hand-rolled by this project - `packages/core/src/
   runtime/builtins/wasi.ts` only adapts a Node-fs-shaped `options.fs`
   backend onto a real, vendored, complete preview1 implementation
   (`runtime/node/vendor/wasi/*.mjs`, from `@tybys/wasm-util`, part of
   the same emnapi org that ships `@napi-rs/wasm-runtime` - likely
   already exercised by real production napi-rs WASM32-WASI users under
   real Node). Worth a read regardless, but temper expectations
   accordingly - this project's own new code in this area is just the
   `fs`-adapter functions in `createWasiFsAdapter`, not the memory-layout
   code itself.
2. Already checked and ruled out this session: the synchronous cross-
   thread fs bridge (`kernel/fs/syncWireFormat.ts`, `workers/process/
   syncFsClient.ts`, `workers/fs/worker.ts`) is NOT a shared-buffer race
   - `createSyncFsChannelFor` allocates a fresh, independent
   `SharedArrayBuffer` pair per requesting thread (confirmed by reading
   the code directly), and the FS Worker's own single JS thread
   naturally serializes all channels' requests via normal run-to-
   completion semantics. Not worth re-checking without new evidence.
3. ~~Fix the `dwc.preview.fetch()` never-rejects-on-crash gap~~ — **DONE.**
   Root cause: `netRelay.ts`'s `unregisterWorker`/`unregisterVirtualClient`
   silently deleted a dead connection from `pipeConns` without ever
   telling the OTHER end - unlike `relay()`'s own graceful `pipe-close`
   handling, which forwards to whichever side didn't send it. A crashed
   process's peer (e.g. `previewRelay.ts`'s `fetchFromGuestServer`,
   registered as a virtual client) never received any further message,
   so its promise never settled. Fixed by having both cleanup paths send
   a `pipe-close` to the peer before dropping the connection, mirroring
   `relay()`. Verified live: respawned vite directly, triggered the
   known WASM crash via `/src/main.js`, then called
   `dwc.preview.fetch(5173, '/src/main.js')` - before the fix this hung
   until an external timeout; after, it rejects in ~35ms with
   `"connection to port 5173 closed before a full response arrived"`.
   Added two new tests in `netRelay.test.ts` covering both cleanup paths'
   peer-notification directly. Typecheck clean, full suite (586 tests)
   green, build clean. Commit `b42d591`.
4. ~~Fix the static-asset `toHeaders`/`toUTCString` bug~~ — **PARTIALLY
   DONE, and a bigger gap found underneath.** Root cause was exactly as
   suspected: `runtime/builtins/fs.ts`'s `StatResult` only ever exposed
   `mtimeMs` (a number) - real Vite's own static-file-serving middleware
   builds its `Last-Modified` header via `stat.mtime.toUTCString()`, and
   `stat.mtime` was `undefined`. Added a real `mtime: Date` field
   (`new Date(response.mtimeMs)`) to both `statSync`/`lstatSync`'s return
   shape (the async `stat`/`lstat`/`fs.promises` variants all delegate to
   these, so one fix covers every entry point). New test added
   (`fs.test.ts`) asserting `mtime` is a real `Date` whose `.toUTCString()`
   doesn't throw and matches `mtimeMs`. Typecheck clean, full suite (587
   tests) green, build clean. Commit `b363913`.
   **Verified live - the original crash is gone** (`/favicon.svg` now
   gets a real `Last-Modified` header), **but the request still 500s, on
   a NEW, later error: `fs$2.createReadStream is not a function`.** Real
   Vite's static-file-serving code goes on to stream the file via
   `fs.createReadStream(...)`, which this runtime's own `fs` builtin
   doesn't implement at all (grepped - zero references). ~~This is a
   materially bigger gap than the one-field `mtime` fix~~ - **FIXED**,
   see item 10's own follow-up entry below (`createReadStream` implemented
   after the user reported broken images in the now-working Vite 7
   preview) - commit `d79baf3`.
5. ~~Independent of all of the above: `waitForMarker()`'s own masking
   bug~~ - **FIXED**, see item 10's own follow-up entry below - commit
   `933a635`.
6. ~~Given the threading angle has now been pushed about as far as this
   project's own tooling allows...~~ **SUPERSEDED - see the new section
   below.** A working reference implementation (`~/workspace/vivari`, a
   sibling WebContainer-clone project - already the source of the
   ref-counting fix ported into `workers/process/worker.ts`) has hit and
   root-caused the SAME crash class, with a concrete, confirmed-upstream
   explanation and a real workaround strategy. Re-read before assuming
   "needs better tools than this project has" - that conclusion turned
   out to be wrong.

**MAJOR UPDATE, next session: found and read a working reference
implementation of this exact feature (`~/workspace/vivari`) - it hit and
root-caused the same crash, and the cause is a confirmed, real UPSTREAM
BUG in rolldown itself, not a bug in either project's own sandbox.**

`~/workspace/vivari` is a separate, more mature WebContainer-clone
project (Node/Bun/Python-in-the-browser) that this project has already
borrowed from once (the direct/non-debounced MessageChannel ref-count
rewrite in `workers/process/worker.ts`, see item 8). It runs real Vite 8
+ rolldown too, and its own `roadmap.md` (an 853KB, extremely detailed
build log this project doesn't have an equivalent of) documents hitting
the exact same symptom:

> "...the second **rolldown-wasm** bundle panics - `Rolldown panicked
> ... napi-3.10.3/src/tokio_runtime.rs: Access tokio runtime failed in
> spawn` - which traps the wasm (`unreachable`) and crashes the whole
> dev server (server unbinds -> 502). Root cause ... is a known upstream
> rolldown-on-wasi bug, not a Vivari-specific gap."

And, more precisely, from their follow-up root-cause entry:

> "`napi::tokio_runtime::RT` is a Rust `static Option<Runtime>` in the
> (shared) wasm linear memory; it is shut down after the first bundle
> and never re-initialized under wasi, so **the second bundle's
> `tokio::spawn` unwraps `None` -> panic -> wasm `unreachable`** -> the
> dev-server process dies. This is a **known upstream rolldown-on-wasi
> bug that also hits StackBlitz/WebContainer** (rolldown#8747,
> rolldown#9134; napi-rs#2847/#2850, napi-rs#3028) - not something a
> template config can dodge ... and not fixable in our runtime without
> touching rolldown's Rust ... **Confirmed both bundles' pool workers
> boot fine, so it is not a nested-worker spawn deadlock.**"

That last sentence directly refutes the entire multi-thread-race
framing this file spent the last several sessions on: Vivari's own team
explicitly checked and ruled out a threading/worker-spawn cause for
their instance of this exact trap. This is consistent with (not
contradicted by) this project's own finding that forcing every
reachable thread-count knob to its minimum didn't stop the crash - both
projects independently arrived at "it's not really about thread count."

**Does duck-webcontainer-api's crash match this exactly?** Not
confirmed byte-for-byte yet - a live re-test this session, capturing
full (untruncated-before-search) stderr and grepping for `"tokio"`/
`"panicked"`, found neither string before the trap. That's inconclusive,
not disconfirming: a Rust panic hook's own `eprintln!` output goes
through the same WASI `fd_write` path as everything else, and may
simply not survive being flushed before the trap tears the worker down
(this project's own stdout/stderr piping has already been shown fragile
around large/abrupt output more than once this investigation). What
newly-observed evidence DOES support the same underlying class of bug
(a lifecycle/static-state issue tied to "which native call number is
this", not a deterministic per-request logic bug):

- **Confirmed non-deterministic even holding the request constant.**
  Same pristine binary, same request (`/`), back-to-back sessions: one
  run got a clean 200 and then survived FOUR more requests (three
  `/src/main.js` 500s that did NOT crash the process, two more `/`
  200s) with the process still alive throughout; a follow-up run against
  a freshly-redownloaded, byte-identical binary crashed on the very
  first `/` request, same as every prior session's baseline. This is
  exactly the shape of a lifecycle/timing bug, not a deterministic one.
- **The "extra JS overhead changes the outcome" result.** Patching the
  guest's copy of `rolldown-binding.wasi.cjs` to wrap every exported
  function AND every `BindingDevEngine`/`BindingBundler`/`BindingWatcher`/
  `BindingWatcherBundler` prototype method in a counting `console.error`
  wrapper (pure diagnostic instrumentation, meant to count how many
  native calls happen before the crash) changed the observed outcome
  from "crashes reliably" to "doesn't crash across 5 requests" in the
  same session - re-confirmed by immediately reverting to a pristine
  binary and seeing the crash return on the very next run. Inserting
  synchronous JS overhead directly in the native call path measurably
  changing crash-vs-no-crash is a strong, if circumstantial, timing-
  sensitivity signal - consistent with a lifecycle race (e.g. one
  operation's cleanup racing another's use of the same static Rust
  state), not conclusive on its own.
- The call-counting instrumentation itself didn't get far enough to
  directly confirm "native call #2 is what panics" - the trace only
  covers plain exported functions and prototype-own-enumerable methods
  on four class names guessed from the export list; nothing fired
  between `initTraceSubscriber`/`BindingCallableBuiltinPlugin` (setup,
  before "ready") and the point where the (differently-timed) run
  stopped crashing, meaning the actual bundle/transform work happens
  through a call surface this trace didn't reach (likely instance
  methods obtained some other way, e.g. off a returned handle rather
  than the class's own prototype). Worth a more targeted trace if this
  is picked up again - the current one changed the outcome instead of
  just observing it, which is a confound to fix, not a result to trust.

**What Vivari actually does about it (a workaround, not a fix - they say
so explicitly): avoid ever making a second problematic native rolldown
call in the same process**, since patching rolldown's own Rust is out of
scope for either project. Concretely: they pin frameworks that would
otherwise force a second rolldown-driven optimize pass (e.g. Svelte's
SSR dep-optimize) to Vite 7 + esbuild instead of Vite 8 + rolldown for
that specific path (esbuild runs in-process via their own
`esbuild-inproc-patch.js`, sidestepping rolldown/wasi entirely there),
and mark the remaining Vite-8-SSR-required cases (SvelteKit/Nuxt/Astro)
"experimental" rather than claiming they work. For our own demo (a
plain vanilla, non-SSR Vite 8 project), there's no obvious *second*
top-level bundle operation the way Vivari's SSR case has one - but Vite's
own startup dependency-scan step plausibly already makes one internal
native call before "ready" ever prints, which would make any real
request afterward the *second* native call overall, matching the "first
succeeds, second panics" pattern even for a single-optimize-pass demo
like ours.

**Update, same session: fixed both config-loading gaps, ran the actual
`noDiscovery` test - it did NOT eliminate the crash.**

Root-caused and fixed the `--configLoader native` blocker: this
runtime's ESM loader only rewrote a dynamic `import(...)` when its
argument was a bare string literal (`DYNAMIC_IMPORT_RE`) - real Vite's
own native config loader does a COMPUTED specifier
(`import(pathToFileURL(path).href + "?t=" + Date.now())`), which fell
through untouched to genuine native `import()`, which can't resolve a
`file://` URL into this runtime's VFS. Added a fallback pass
(`DYNAMIC_IMPORT_OPEN_RE` + a real paren-matcher over the existing
non-code-masked text) that finds any `import(...)` call the literal
path missed and routes it through the same `__dwcDynamicImport`
resolver, plus normalizing a `file://`-prefixed specifier (stripping
the cache-busting query) before resolution. Found and fixed two real
false-positive traps along the way, both live in real Vite's own
`dist/node/module-runner.js`: a `.import(...)` PROPERTY/METHOD CALL
(`this.import(acceptedPath)`, real Vite's own `ModuleRunner` API)
mistaken for the dynamic-import keyword (fixed with the same `(?<!\.)`
guard `moduleLoader.ts`'s CJS-side rewriter already uses), and an
`import(id) { ... }` METHOD DECLARATION (`async import(id) {...}` -
no preceding `.` for that guard to catch) also mistaken for a call
(fixed by checking whether the closing paren is followed by a block,
which a real call expression never is). Five new tests, full suite
(592 tests) green, verified live. Commit `b04b0b4`.

**With both blockers gone, the actual `noDiscovery` test finally ran:**
`vite.config.js` with `optimizeDeps: {noDiscovery: true, include: []}`,
spawned with `--configLoader native`. Config loaded correctly this
time, and startup printed no "[rolldown] Downloading..." /
dependency-scan messages at all - confirming the dep-scan step was
genuinely skipped, meaning a served request really was the first
native rolldown call in the process. **It still crashed on the very
first `/` request**, same `RuntimeError` signature as always. This
refutes the simple form of the "avoid a second native call" theory -
either something else still makes an earlier native call this test
didn't account for, or the crash isn't purely a call-count issue for
this runtime's specific case (it may still be the SAME upstream bug
Vivari found, just triggered on the very first call here rather than
the second, given how non-deterministic every characterization of this
crash has been all along).

**Technique note, worth keeping:** when capturing a spawned process's
stdout/stderr for diagnosis, truncate each chunk to a small size (a few
hundred chars) in the pump loop itself, not just when displaying it -
one run this session buffered a single ~163MB stderr chunk (a crash's
own JS-level stack trace, referencing an ESM module by its full
base64-encoded `data:` URL - the same class of issue this file's own
"Diagnostic techniques" section already documented once) into a plain
array, which briefly destabilized the tab and blocked normal
`javascript_exec` calls returning it until it was cleared. Decoding a
short slice of a huge captured string as character codes (`Array.from
(str.slice(0,150)).map(c => c.charCodeAt(0))`, then decoded outside the
browser) is a reliable way to safely inspect the START of a
too-large-to-return string without pulling the whole thing through the
browser tool's own content filters or the agent's own context.

## 10. MAJOR MILESTONE — a real, working, crash-free live Vite dev server preview, via Vite 7 (esbuild) instead of Vite 8 (rolldown) — DONE

**This is the actual working outcome the whole multi-session
investigation (items 8 and 9) was chasing.** `examples/playground`'s
own demo now scaffolds a real `npm create vite@latest` project, pins it
to `vite@^7` with two npm `overrides`, installs, runs `npm run dev`,
and shows a real, interactive, correctly-rendered Vite dev server
preview in the page's `<iframe id="preview">` - verified live,
repeatedly, with zero crashes: the iframe's own `document.title`
(`"my-app"`) and `document.body.innerText` (the real vanilla template's
"Get started" / "Edit src/main.js and save to test HMR" / "Count is 0"
/ documentation-links content) both confirmed correct across a full
page reload and dozens of direct `preview.fetch()` requests to `/`,
`/src/main.js`, `/src/counter.js`, `/src/style.css`, and the ~175KB
`/@vite/client`. Commit `26e61c5` wires this into the real demo;
commits `ceedb53` and `6fd49ab` are the two general runtime fixes this
work uncovered along the way.

Given item 9's crash is a confirmed upstream rolldown bug, and Vivari's
own proven workaround for the exact same bug is to route the affected
path through **esbuild instead of rolldown** (Vite 7 uses esbuild for
dev-time transforms; Vite 8 is what pulled in rolldown in the first
place), pinned the demo to `vite@^7` instead of latest. Getting there
surfaced three real, independent bugs (two now fixed in this runtime,
one a well-known real npm/rollup quirk worked around the same way
StackBlitz-style demos do) - all found by scaffolding a SEPARATE
`/my-app-v7` project by hand (`npm create vite@latest my-app-v7`, then
editing `package.json` to pin `vite: "^7.0.0"` + the `overrides` before
`npm install`, to avoid racing the playground's own automatic `/my-app`
demo flow) before folding the working recipe into `main.ts` itself.

1. **`esbuild`'s own postinstall script can't run at all - fixed via a
   standard npm mechanism, not a runtime patch.** Plain `esbuild`
   (a real dependency of Vite 7) ships a native binary per platform,
   selected via `optionalDependencies`; this runtime reports a normal-
   looking `process.platform`/`process.arch` ("linux"/"x64", NOT the
   `process.versions.webcontainer`-based fallback rolldown itself
   relies on - see item 9), so npm's own platform-matching selects a
   REAL, non-runnable native binary, and esbuild's own `install.js`
   falls back to validating a JS/WASM path via `execFileSync
   (process.execPath, [toPath, '--version'])` - which fails outright,
   since `process.execPath` here is a fixed string (`/usr/bin/node`)
   with no real file at that VFS path to execute. Rather than patching
   this runtime's own `child_process`/`execFileSync` to somehow support
   self-reinvocation (a much bigger undertaking), used the SAME real
   npm feature StackBlitz-style demos commonly use for exactly this:
   an `overrides` field aliasing the dependency itself -
   `"overrides": { "esbuild": "npm:esbuild-wasm@^0.25.0" }` - so every
   transitive `require('esbuild')` in the tree actually resolves to
   `esbuild-wasm`'s own content, whose postinstall doesn't need this
   native-binary dance at all. **Confirmed working**: `npm install`
   succeeded cleanly afterward. Unlike Vivari (whose single-threaded
   cooperative kernel needs `esbuild-inproc-patch.js` to avoid a real
   deadlock when esbuild-wasm's Node build spawns a child process and
   talks over stdio), this project's dedicated-real-Worker-per-process
   architecture may not need an equivalent in-process patch at all -
   worth confirming once further along, but not yet hit as a problem.
2. ~~`readFileSync(url)` with a real `URL` object crashed on startup~~ -
   **FIXED**, see the dedicated commit (`ceedb53`) and its own message
   for the full root cause: real Vite 7's `dist/node/chunks/logger.js`
   finds its own `package.json` via a doubly-nested
   `readFileSync(new URL("../../package.json", new URL(...)))`, and
   this runtime's `fs.*Sync` functions only ever accepted a `string`
   path - a `URL` object silently stringified to a bogus VFS path
   somewhere downstream, producing `ENOENT: /file:/my-app-v7/
   node_modules/vite/package.json` (note the collapsed/malformed
   slashes - not just an un-stripped `file://` prefix, something further
   downstream also mishandled the string). Fixed generically for every
   fs op's path-shaped field, not just `readFileSync`, since this is a
   completely standard, common real-Node pattern (any `import.meta.url`-
   relative file access) likely to recur.
3. ~~`Error: Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-musl`~~ -
   **WORKED AROUND, same technique as the esbuild fix above, not a
   runtime patch.** This is a well-known, REAL npm bug that affects
   actual users on real machines too (npm's optionalDependencies
   resolution sometimes fails to correctly select/skip a platform-
   specific package - referenced directly in the error message:
   https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4828), not something specific to
   this runtime. Rather than chasing npm's own bug, added a second
   `overrides` entry aliasing `rollup` itself to `@rollup/wasm-node` (a
   real, actively-published WASM build of rollup, the same "alias the
   dependency" trick as `esbuild` -> `esbuild-wasm` above):
   `"overrides": { "esbuild": "npm:esbuild-wasm@^0.25.0", "rollup":
   "npm:@rollup/wasm-node@^4.43.0" }`. This ALSO surfaced one more real,
   independent runtime bug on the way - `@rollup/wasm-node` does
   `import { gzip } from 'zlib'` at its own top level, which this
   runtime's `zlib` shim didn't export at all (only the streaming
   `createGzip`/`createGunzip` factories existed, no one-shot callback
   API) - see zlib.js's own doc comment and commit `6fd49ab` for the
   fix (built on the same `CompressionStream`/`DecompressionStream`
   transform the streaming factories already use).
4. **Confirmed: `vite@7 dev` serves a page without hitting item 9's
   rolldown crash at all** - the actual question this whole detour was
   chasing. With all three bugs above resolved, `vite@7` reaches
   `VITE v7.3.6 ready` cleanly and serves real, repeated requests (`/`,
   `/src/main.js`, `/src/counter.js`, `/src/style.css`,
   `/@vite/client`) with consistent 200s and correct content sizes
   across multiple full rounds - no crash, not even once, across
   dozens of requests (compare to item 9's rolldown path, which crashed
   on nearly every first real request). Folded the whole recipe into
   `examples/playground/src/main.ts` itself (commit `26e61c5`) as the
   demo's new default, rather than leaving it as a hand-scaffolded
   side experiment.

**Net result**: this is the recommended path for real Vite dev-server
support in this runtime until rolldown's own upstream tokio-lifecycle
bug is fixed - pin to Vite 7, alias `esbuild`/`rollup` to their real
WASM builds via `overrides`. All three fixes landed this round
(`ceedb53`'s URL-accepting `fs`, `6fd49ab`'s zlib `gzip`/`gunzip`, plus
item 9's own `b04b0b4` dynamic-import support) have value independent
of Vite specifically - all are common, general Node patterns this
runtime now handles correctly that it didn't before this investigation
started.

**Not yet checked, worth a future look:** whether this project's own
dedicated-real-Worker-per-process architecture needs an equivalent to
Vivari's `esbuild-inproc-patch.js` (their single-threaded cooperative
kernel deadlocks when esbuild-wasm's Node build spawns a real child
process and talks over stdio) - live testing this session never
observed a hang or deadlock from this, suggesting this project's
different process architecture may not share that specific problem,
but it wasn't deliberately stress-tested for it either.

**Follow-up, same milestone: user reported "the asset like img seem not
show correctly" in the now-working preview - `fs.createReadStream`
implemented, fixing it.** This is the SAME gap item 9 already flagged
as "still open" (`fs$2.createReadStream is not a function`, found while
fixing the `toHeaders`/`toUTCString` static-asset crash, left
unimplemented at the time as a bigger, separate follow-up) - it just
took until a real, rendering preview existed for a real user to
actually SEE the symptom (broken image icons) rather than read about it
in a 500 response.

Implemented as an eagerly-read (not truly incrementally streamed - this
VFS has no real disk to stream FROM a chunk at a time) `stream.Readable`
factory, injected into `createFsBuiltin` the same way `wrapBuffer`
already is for `Buffer` (`fs.ts` has no `require()` of its own to reach
`stream` directly). `{start, end}` is supported for HTTP Range requests
(`end` inclusive, matching real Node). Both real worker entry points
(`workers/process/worker.ts`, `workers/workerThreads/worker.ts`) wire in
the SAME real vendored `Readable` class guest code's own `require
('stream')` returns, not a hand-rolled stand-in, so `.pipe(res)` (real
Vite's own static-serving middleware) works unmodified. Two new tests
(whole-file read, byte-range read) exercise it against a genuine
`node:stream` `Readable` in the test itself. Typecheck clean, full
suite (596 tests) green, build clean. Commit `d79baf3`.

**Verified live, precisely** (not just "looks fine in a screenshot"):
checked the actual rendered preview iframe's own `<img>` elements'
`.complete`/`.naturalWidth`/`.naturalHeight` properties directly - all
5 images on the vanilla template's real "Get started" page (an 8.7KB
`vite.svg` fetched twice, a real `hero.png`, two inlined `data:` URL
SVGs unaffected by this fix either way) report `complete: true` with
real, non-zero dimensions (e.g. the PNG: `343×361`). Before this fix,
any image actually served over HTTP (not inlined as a `data:` URL)
would have 500'd exactly like `/favicon.svg` did in item 9's own
original finding.

**Follow-up, same milestone: replaced the whole e2e suite - it was
completely stale.** `examples/playground/e2e/boot.spec.ts` asserted
against demo content (`process.spawn`/`shell.exec`/`net`/
`child_process` console messages, etc.) that no longer exists anywhere
in `main.ts` - it had been rewritten several times across sessions,
most recently into the npm-create-vite-and-preview-it flow this
investigation got working. Every one of the old tests was guaranteed
to fail if actually run - there was, in effect, zero automated
coverage of anything current. Replaced with one real end-to-end test
of the actual flow: scaffold, pin to Vite 7 + the overrides, real
`npm install`, `npm run dev`, real preview - asserting terminal
progress at each stage, a specific regression guard for item 9's own
crash text (`RuntimeError`/`Cannot find module`), the preview iframe's
real `document.title`, and at least one real (non-`data:`-URL) image
loading with real dimensions - directly exercising the
`createReadStream` fix. Verified 3 consecutive clean runs, ~20-25s
each (fast - real npm's own registry-response caching, not a cold
install each time). Commit `e1373a9`.

**Follow-up, same milestone: fixed `waitForMarker()`'s own masking
bug** (flagged unfixed since item 8, repeated again in item 9's own
next-steps list). It resolved whenever its stream closed, whether or
not the marker text had actually appeared - so a process crashing or
exiting before ever printing its own ready banner looked identical to
one that started successfully. Now rejects instead, with `main()`
catching that specifically and reporting the real exit code (same
early-return pattern already used for a nonzero npm create/install
exit code) rather than silently proceeding to preview a server that
was never actually running. Verified the happy path is unaffected: the
e2e test above still passes end to end after this change. Commit
`933a635`.

## 11. Real WebSocket/HMR transport — DONE and verified working end-to-end; a SEPARATE gap (`fs.watch` is a no-op stub) blocks true observable HMR

Follow-up to item 10: with a real, crash-free Vite preview working for
plain HTTP, the browser console showed `[vite] failed to connect to
websocket` - no WebSocket support existed anywhere in this runtime
(`grep -rln "WebSocket" packages/core/src` was empty, `http.js` never
emitted an `'upgrade'` event). This item built the real transport.

**Key design insight, confirmed by reading real Vite 7's own bundled
code** (`dist/node/chunks/config.js`, `dist/client/client.mjs`): Vite's
dev server already vendors a COMPLETE `WebSocketServer` (`ws`-shaped,
`new WebSocketServerRaw({noServer:true})`), driven via Node's own
`http.Server`'s `'upgrade'` event. So the guest side needed only to
correctly hand a socket off on Upgrade - no WS protocol logic had to be
implemented in guest code at all. All the new protocol logic
(handshake, RFC 6455 framing) lives in the KERNEL worker instead, which
already has direct `netRelay` access and `crypto.subtle` (same as any
page) - `apis/Preview.ts` stays what it already was, a thin relay,
extended with one more `postMessage` shape rather than a new transport.

**What was built** (full design in the plan this was implemented from):
1. `runtime/node/internal/httpWireFormat.ts` - one additive
   `HttpParser.drainPending()` method: recovers bytes already buffered
   past the most recently parsed message (e.g. the first WS frame,
   stapled to the same chunk as a 101 handshake response) that would
   otherwise be silently trapped in the parser's private state.
2. `runtime/node/lib/http.js` - `Server` now detects an Upgrade request
   and emits a real `'upgrade'` event with `(req, socket, head)`,
   removing the old HTTP-request `'data'` listener first so later raw
   WS frame bytes never get fed back into it.
3. `workers/kernel/wsFrame.ts` (new) - a pure RFC 6455 codec: masked
   frame encoding (mandatory for every host→guest frame - a compliant
   server rejects unmasked ones), incremental decode with continuation-
   frame reassembly, ping/pong, close-frame payload codec.
   permessage-deflate is sidestepped entirely (never negotiated in the
   handshake request), not implemented.
4. `workers/kernel/previewSocket.ts` (new, sibling to `previewRelay.ts`)
   - `openPreviewSocket`/`sendPreviewSocketMessage`/`closePreviewSocket`:
   real handshake (`Sec-WebSocket-Key` → verified `Sec-WebSocket-Accept`
   via `crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-1", ...)`), then steady-state framing
   over the same `netRelay.pipeConnect`/`relay` pipe `previewRelay.ts`
   uses for plain HTTP - confirmed that transport is already persistent/
   bidirectional/unlimited-message; the old "one request then close"
   behavior was purely `fetchFromGuestServer`'s own policy, not a
   transport limit.
5. `workers/kernel/worker.ts` - three new router entries,
   `PREVIEW_WS_OPEN`/`PREVIEW_WS_SEND`/`PREVIEW_WS_CLOSE`, mirroring the
   existing `PROCESS_STDIN`/`PROCESS_KILL` shape.
6. `apis/Preview.ts` - `createPreviewAPI` now takes `(request, on)`
   (matching `Process.ts`'s existing shape); a same-origin
   `window.addEventListener("message", ...)` channel relays `dwc:ws-*`
   messages from a preview iframe to the kernel and kernel `preview:ws-
   message`/`preview:ws-close` events back down to whichever iframe
   opened that `wsId`.
7. `workers/preview/wsPolyfill.ts` (new) - the actual `WebSocket`
   replacement, injected as a classic inline `<script>` (runs
   synchronously during HTML parsing, before any deferred
   `type="module"` script regardless of position) into every HTML
   response. A Service Worker can never intercept a page's own `new
   WebSocket(...)` call (confirmed real browser platform limitation),
   so this is the only way to route Vite's client through the kernel.
8. `workers/preview/previewHtmlInject.ts` (new) - `injectPreviewWsBootstrap`,
   kept in its own module rather than inline in `PreviewServiceWorker.ts`
   for a real, load-bearing reason (see the bug below), wired into that
   file's `fetch` handler: HTML responses (uncompressed only - this SW
   never decodes `content-encoding`) get the polyfill script inserted
   after `<head>` (or prepended if none), with the now-stale
   `content-length` header removed.

**Real bug #1, caught only by actually registering the Service Worker in
a browser (not by any unit test): a top-level `export` breaks a
classic-script Service Worker.** First pass exported
`injectPreviewWsBootstrap` directly from `PreviewServiceWorker.ts` for
testability. `Preview.ts`'s `enable()` registers the SW via
`navigator.serviceWorker.register(url, {scope})` with no `{type:
"module"}`, i.e. as a CLASSIC script - and tsup already bundles that
entry with all internal imports inlined (no bare `import`/`export`
survives), which is exactly why the file worked fine before despite
already having an `import` in its source. Adding a top-level `export`
put a real `export` statement into the final classic-script bundle - a
SyntaxError there, surfacing as `ServiceWorker script evaluation
failed` with the registration silently rejecting. Fixed by moving
`injectPreviewWsBootstrap` into its own module (`previewHtmlInject.ts`)
that `PreviewServiceWorker.ts` only ever *imports* (tsup inlines it,
same as the existing `wsPolyfill.ts` import) - never exports anything
itself. Caught by actually calling `navigator.serviceWorker.register()`
in a real browser tab; nothing in the unit tests (which stub `self` and
never touch real SW registration semantics) could have caught this.

**Real bug #2, also only catchable live: `Object.create(EventTarget.
prototype)` doesn't make a real EventTarget.** The polyfill's first
version built `DwcWebSocket` the old ES5 way -
`DwcWebSocket.prototype = Object.create(EventTarget.prototype)`. Every
`addEventListener`/`dispatchEvent` call on an instance threw `TypeError:
Illegal invocation` - `EventTarget`'s native methods brand-check for
internal slots that only actually get set up by really calling
`EventTarget`'s own constructor (via `super()` in a real subclass, or
`Reflect.construct`), not just inheriting its prototype. Fixed by
rewriting `DwcWebSocket` as a real `class DwcWebSocket extends
EventTarget { constructor() { super(); ... } }`. Confirmed by
constructing a `DwcWebSocket` directly inside the live preview iframe
and calling `addEventListener` on it - the exact repro.

**Verified working, end to end, for real** (not just unit tests):
loaded the actual playground demo in a real Chrome tab, waited for the
real preview to come up, then from the OUTER page drove
`new (previewIframe.contentWindow.WebSocket)("ws://localhost/",
"vite-hmr")` directly - confirming: the polyfill installs
(`window.__dwcRealWebSocket` present, `window.WebSocket` replaced), the
constructed socket reaches `readyState === 1` (OPEN), and
`ws.protocol === "vite-hmr"` - i.e. a genuine RFC 6455 handshake
(masked key generation, SHA-1 accept-key verification, subprotocol
negotiation) succeeded against REAL Vite-bundled `ws` server code
running inside the guest sandbox, over the full
polyfill→postMessage→kernel→netRelay→guest-http.js→Vite chain. No
`[vite] failed to connect to websocket]` text appeared anywhere in the
terminal/console across this or any earlier run this session.

**Unit tests** (all new, all passing, full suite 638/638 green):
`http_parser.test.ts` (`drainPending` incl. the exact 101-plus-stapled-
WS-frame case), `http.test.ts` (`'upgrade'` event incl. proving the old
data listener is actually removed, and the no-listener-registered
`socket.destroy()` case), `wsFrame.test.ts` (17 cases: masked/unmasked
round-trip at every length-encoding boundary 0/125/126/65535/65536,
continuation-frame reassembly, ping/pong, close payload codec),
`previewSocket.test.ts` (10 cases: real handshake against a fake WS-
accepting guest server, bad-accept/non-101 rejection, stapled-frame
decode, masked send, guest-close and simulated-crash cleanup),
`previewHtmlInject.test.ts` (4 cases), `Preview.test.ts` (extended, 6
new WS-relay cases). `examples/playground/e2e/boot.spec.ts` extended
with a real assertion (polyfill installed + a WebSocket dialed through
it reaches `open protocol=vite-hmr readyState=1`) - 3 consecutive clean
Playwright runs, ~19-24s each.

**This item's scope was deliberately the TRANSPORT only, per the
approved plan, and that scope is genuinely done and proven correct.**
It does NOT mean editing a guest file now live-updates the preview -
testing that directly (stamped a DOM marker in the iframe, edited
`/my-app/src/style.css` via `dwc.fs.writeFile()`, waited 15+s) showed
no change and no marker loss. Root cause, confirmed by reading the
source: `runtime/builtins/fs.ts`'s `watch()` is a **complete no-op
stub** - it builds a real-looking `FSWatcher` object with working
`on`/`off`/`close`, but nothing anywhere ever calls those listeners on
a real file mutation (`writeFileSync` et al. never notify it). Vite's
own dev server relies on exactly this (via chokidar) to learn a file
changed at all; without it, Vite never has a reason to push anything
over the now-fully-working WebSocket connection, regardless of how
correct that connection is. **This is a separate, not-yet-scoped
follow-up** - making `fs.watch` real (wiring change notifications
into the write-path functions, handling recursive/directory watches)
- not attempted in this pass since it's a materially different, larger
piece of work than the transport this item was scoped to.

Per standing preference, commit messages for this project should not
include `Co-Authored-By`/session-link footers.

## 12. MAJOR MILESTONE — `fs.watch` is real; a live guest file edit now updates the running preview via HMR, verified end-to-end — DONE

Follow-up to item 11's own closing gap: `fs.watch()` was a complete no-op
stub, so even though the real WebSocket/HMR transport worked, Vite's dev
server (via chokidar) never learned a file had changed and never had a
reason to push anything over it. This item wires real change notifications
through the whole stack and confirms the actual end-to-end outcome live -
not just that a listener fires, but that a real `dwc.fs.writeFile()` call
now visibly updates the running Vite preview with no reload.

**Design.** The single choke point every fs mutation passes through -
regardless of whether it came from a guest process's synchronous
SharedArrayBuffer bridge (`kernel/fs/syncServer.ts`) or the kernel's async
`FS_REQUEST` path (`workers/fs/worker.ts`'s `handleFsRequest`, also what
`dwc.fs.*` itself proxies into) - is the one shared `VirtualFileSystem`
instance living in the (single, dedicated) FS Worker. `VirtualFileSystem.
onChange(listener)` (new) is called internally by every mutating op
(`writeFile`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `rename`, `symlink`, `chmod`) with a real
Node-shaped `{eventType: "rename"|"change", path}` event - `writeFile`
distinguishes a brand-new file ("rename") from an overwrite ("change") by
checking whether the target already existed; a recursive `mkdir -p` emits
one "rename" per directory segment it actually creates, not just the final
leaf; `rename` emits two events (source and destination, since a watcher on
either directory is a separate registration). New unit tests in
`VirtualFileSystem.test.ts` cover all of this directly against the VFS, no
Worker plumbing involved.

The FS Worker (`workers/fs/worker.ts`) subscribes to `vfs.onChange` once at
boot and keeps a process-agnostic `watchRegistry` (`watchId -> {path,
recursive, processId}`), populated by two new `FsRequestPayload` actions
(`"watch"`/`"unwatch"`, plus `"unwatchProcess"` for cleanup - see below).
On a real mutation, it matches every registered watch against the changed
path (`kernel/fs/watchMatch.ts`, new - `matchesWatch`/`watchFilename`,
extracted into their own pure, directly-unit-tested module rather than left
inline in the Worker file, matching this project's existing "keep testable
logic out of the untestable Worker entry point" pattern) and, for each
match, posts an unsolicited `"fs-change"` event (via the already-existing
but previously-unused `postEvent()` in `workers/fs/service.ts` - this
plumbing existed already, just had no caller until now) carrying
`{processId, watchId, eventType, filename}`.

Routing that event back to the right guest process needed one new piece:
`workers/kernel/fsClient.ts` previously only ever handled *reply* envelopes
from the FS Worker (`isReply`) - `onEvent(handler)` (new) also dispatches
*event* envelopes (`isEvent`, an existing but previously-unused envelope
kind from `protocol/envelope.ts`). `workers/kernel/worker.ts` wires this
once at the top level: `fsClient.onEvent(...)` looks up the target Worker
via `processTable.getWorker(processId)` (the same lookup `PROCESS_STDIN`
already uses to reach an already-running process from outside its own
`bootProcess()` closure) and `postMessage`s it a `"fs-watch-event"`.

On the guest side, `workers/process/worker.ts` gained
`createFsWatchBridge(eventLoop)` - `watch(path, recursive, onEvent)` posts
`"fs-watch-register"` to the kernel (handled in `processClient.ts`'s
`bootProcess()`, which forwards to `fsClient.request({action: "watch", ...})`)
and refs the event loop for as long as the returned handle is open, mirroring
real Node's own "an active FSWatcher keeps the process alive" semantics and
the same `eventLoop.ref()`/`unref()` pattern `worker_threads.Worker`/net's
own `recount()` already use - without it, a guest script whose entire job is
`fs.watch(dir, cb)` (no server, no timer) would tear itself down before ever
seeing a change. `runtime/builtins/fs.ts`'s `watch()` is now real: it calls
an injected `watchBridge.watch()` (same "externally injected, defaults to a
harmless stand-in" shape as `wrapBuffer`/`createReadableFromBytes` already
use, so this file's own existing tests and `workers/workerThreads/worker.ts`'s
minimal guest environment keep working unchanged with no bridge wired in)
and fans a bridge event out to every listener registered via the constructor
argument or `.on("change", ...)`.

**Cleanup.** A process that's killed or crashes without ever calling
`FSWatcher.close()` would otherwise leak its `watchRegistry` entries
forever. `processClient.ts`'s three existing worker-teardown sites (the
`"exit"` message handler, `worker.onerror`, and `kill()`) each already call
`netRelay.unregisterWorker(processId)` for the exact same reason - a fourth
call, `fsClient.request({action: "unwatchProcess", processId})`, was added
alongside all three, mirroring that existing precedent rather than
inventing a new cleanup convention.

**Verified live, precisely** (not just unit tests - the actual acceptance
bar this item needed to clear): extended `examples/playground/e2e/
boot.spec.ts`'s existing real end-to-end test (real `npm create vite`, real
`npm install`, real `vite dev`, real preview) with one more step after
confirming the WebSocket/HMR transport itself is open - call
`dwc.fs.writeFile()` from the HOST page (the same `FS_REQUEST` path a real
code-editor UI would use, exercising the full stack end to end, not a
guest-internal shortcut) to append a `body { background-color: rgb(1, 2, 3)
!important; }` rule to the scaffolded `/my-app/src/style.css`, then poll the
live preview iframe's own `getComputedStyle(document.body).backgroundColor`.
**Passed**: the preview's computed background color updates to the injected
marker color with no page reload - real Vite CSS HMR, driven by a real
`fs.watch` notification, over the real WebSocket transport item 11 already
proved, following a real guest file write from the host page. Full suite
(1 test, ~53-57s) green, zero page errors. This closes the loop item 11
explicitly left open: "making a guest file edit actually visible in the
preview still doesn't work" - it now does.

Unit tests: `VirtualFileSystem.test.ts` (5 new `onChange` cases),
`watchMatch.test.ts` (new, 7 cases covering non-recursive/recursive/root
matching and filename computation). Full core suite (654 tests) green,
typecheck clean, build clean.

## 13. Tried Vite 8 + rolldown again - found and fixed a real, general esmLoader bug along the way, but the original item 9/10 upstream crash is CONFIRMED STILL THE BLOCKER

Prompted by reading `~/workspace/vivari`'s own `roadmap.md` again: it
documents pinning `vite: "^8.0.0"` successfully, which looked like it might
mean the item 9/10 rolldown crash was avoidable after all. Their template
also declares `"@rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi"` as an explicit
`devDependency` - worth testing directly rather than reasoning from that
alone, since two different things were going on in their own investigation
(see below).

**What Vivari's roadmap actually says, read closely:** their own template
broke for an UNRELATED reason first - rolldown 1.2.2 stopped listing
`@rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi` as an `optionalDependency`, so npm's
platform auto-select stopped installing it, and rolldown's own
`webcontainer-fallback.cjs` (the same `execFileSync('pnpm i ...')` path this
project's own item 8/9 work already found fragile) failed for them the same
way. Their fix - declaring the binding explicitly - avoids THAT bug, not
the tokio-runtime one. Separately, their roadmap explicitly states the real
tokio panic **still exists and still pins Svelte to Vite 7** in their own
templates, and only doesn't fire for their plain client-rendered
React/Vue/Preact templates because "the panic... needs TWO rolldown
dep-optimize passes in one process... and what forces the second is an SSR
optimize" - a plain client app runs exactly one pass and never trips it.

**Tested directly rather than assumed**, in a throwaway `/my-app-v8`
scaffold (same isolated-scaffold technique item 10 itself used): pinned
`vite: "^8.0.0"` + `"@rolldown/binding-wasm32-wasi": "^1.2.4"` (a version at
or after upstream's own fix for a separate `@emnapi/*` peer-mismatch bug
Vivari also found) as explicit `devDependencies` in a real
`npm create vite@latest -- --template vanilla` scaffold.

1. **`npm install` succeeded** (Vivari's binding-declaration fix holds).
2. **`npm run dev` hit a missing builtin**: `util.isDeepStrictEqual` -
   **fixed**, a real, spec-accurate implementation (`Object.is` primitive
   semantics, strict prototype equality, Map/Set/Date/RegExp/TypedArray
   support, circular-reference tracking), not a narrow stand-in. Commit
   `473d6d3`.
3. **Then hit something new and much bigger: a ~65 million character stack
   trace** from a `buildCrawler`-adjacent failure, before the process was
   killed. Proven (not just observed) to be a real, general, EXPONENTIAL
   bug in this project's own `esmLoader.ts` - completely unrelated to
   Vite 8 specifically - via a direct, isolated reproduction (a synthetic
   "diamond" dependency graph): `buildModule()` spliced a dependency's own
   full, already-recursively-inlined `data:` URL directly into every
   importer's rewritten source, so a shared dependency's content duplicates
   once per importer, compounding with graph depth (~2.67x per level
   measured: 7.5KB at depth 1 -> 7.2MB at depth 8). **Fixed** by extending
   `buildCjsShim`'s existing snapshot-into-`globalThis` pattern (already
   used for CJS/builtin/circular edges) to every genuine ESM->ESM static
   edge - a target is now actually evaluated via a real `import()` and
   replaced by a tiny reference shim instead of its own inlined content, so
   output size scales with the number of distinct modules touched, not the
   number of paths through the graph. Commit `8a6bf9c`.

   Two more real bugs surfaced building this fix, both caught by the new
   test suite itself, not found by inspection:
   - **An intermittent `SyntaxError`, not a logic bug**: shim slot IDs
     embed a random per-instance prefix (added so concurrent vitest
     instances in one process can't collide on the same shared
     `globalThis.__dwcCjsShims` object) and were accessed via DOT notation
     (`globalThis.__dwcCjsShims.51i02g_s0`) - invalid syntax whenever
     `Math.random()`'s own output happened to start with a digit. Fixed by
     switching every slot-ID access to bracket notation, which needs no
     identifier-validity guarantee at all.
   - **A genuine cycle-detection design gap, caught by a new concurrent-
     dynamic-import test, not assumed away**: a flat, global "is this path
     currently building" `Set` couldn't distinguish a REAL cycle (an
     ancestor of the CURRENT build) from a benign concurrent SIBLING
     reference (an unrelated build that happens to be in flight - e.g. two
     concurrent dynamic imports both reaching the same shared dependency,
     structurally impossible before this fix made building genuinely
     async). Fixed by replacing the flat set with per-call ancestry chains
     threaded through `buildModule`/`resolveStaticEdge`.

   Accepted, documented tradeoff (same one already made for CJS/circular
   edges, now widened to every ESM edge): an exported `let`/`var`
   REASSIGNED after initial evaluation is no longer observed as live by
   importers - checked directly against real code, not just asserted: zero
   `export let` occurrences anywhere in vendored `vite@8.2.2`/rolldown's own
   `dist/`. New `esmLoader.test.ts` (none existed before) covers the size
   regression directly, this tradeoff (locked in as an explicit test, not
   silent drift), cycles combined with diamond-shaped reuse, and concurrent
   dynamic imports. Full suite (672 tests) green, typecheck/build clean.

4. **Re-ran the exact same live scaffold after the fix**: `npm install` and
   `npm run dev` now proceed with no runaway output, and
   `dwc.preview.fetch(5173, "/")` returns a real 200. **Then, on a
   follow-up request, the dev server process crashed with
   `Uncaught RuntimeError: unreachable`** - the exact same trap signature
   item 9 originally found and item 9/10's own root-cause work confirmed is
   a real, upstream rolldown/napi-rs tokio-runtime lifecycle bug, not
   fixable from this project's side. **This definitively answers the
   question this whole detour was chasing: Vite 8/rolldown is still
   blocked by the same confirmed-upstream bug as before** - the
   `esmLoader.ts` fix and the `util.isDeepStrictEqual` fix were both real,
   were both masking the actual crash behind earlier, different failures,
   and are both worth keeping regardless, but neither one (nor both
   together) makes Vite 8 usable. The Vite 7 workaround (item 10) remains
   the right path until upstream fixes the tokio-runtime issue.

Per standing preference, commit messages for this project should not
include `Co-Authored-By`/session-link footers.

## 14. `dwc.npm` moved into the library, `dwc.shell.spawn()` added for live progress, and a long-standing "create-vite: command not found" bug finally root-caused (took three tries)

### `dwc.npm` — the npm-loading mechanism is now part of `@dwc/core`, not the playground app

Previously `examples/playground/src/vendorNpm.ts` (app-level) fetched a
locally-built `public/vendor/npm.json` asset and mounted it into the VFS.
Decision this session: move the *mechanism* (decode → mount → node-gyp
stub → `/bin/npm.js`/`npx.js`/`pnpm.js` shims) into the library as
`dwc.npm.load(asset)`/`loadFrom(url)`, while deliberately keeping *which
npm version, how the asset is built* an app-level concern - `@dwc/core`
doesn't ship or pin any particular npm version itself. This mirrors how
`~/workspace/vivari` (a sibling WebContainer-clone project, referenced
for research purposes only - see the "Remove all references to the
vivari project" commit for why it's not named in code/docs) splits the
same problem: its own `vendor-npm.mjs` build script stays outside its
`packages/kernel-host` library package, only the load/mount mechanism
moved in.

**Then taken further: `dwc.npm.install(version?)` needs no local build
step or vendored asset at all.** New `packages/core/src/apis/npm/npmTar.ts`
resolves a version against the real npm registry's own abbreviated
metadata endpoint (confirmed via `curl`: both
`registry.npmjs.org/npm` and its tarball endpoint send
`access-control-allow-origin: *`, so a browser can fetch them directly,
no proxy needed), fetches the real `.tgz`, gunzips it via the native
`DecompressionStream` Web API (this code runs host-side, not inside the
guest sandbox, so there's no need for this project's own guest-side
pure-JS inflate), and parses the raw POSIX ustar/PAX tar format by hand
(a small, from-scratch reader - handles GNU long-name and PAX
extended-header entries, needed for real npm's own deeply-nested
`node_modules/@scope/pkg` paths). Verified directly against the real
npm@12.0.2 tarball (not just unit-tested): extraction is byte-for-byte
correct, 1594 files, including scoped packages like
`node_modules/@gar/promise-retry/*` that a subsequent bug (see below)
briefly looked like it might be dropping.

`examples/playground/src/vendorNpm.ts` and its build-time
`scripts/vendor-npm.mjs` step are gone; `main.ts` just calls
`dwc.npm.install("10.9.2")` (or no argument, for whatever `latest`
currently resolves to).

### The Vite dev-server console leak — root-caused, but the fix made things worse; reverted

Confirmed root cause (traced, not guessed): `packages/core/src/workers/
process/worker.ts`'s `boot()` does `Object.assign(self, {console: {...
guest stdout shim...}})` - a GLOBAL replacement of the Worker's own
ambient `console`, needed because the guest module wrapper (`new
Function(...)`) closes over the real global scope and real Node's own
`console`/`process`/`global` are ambient globals too, not module-wrapper
parameters. Because `@dwc/core` is a pnpm workspace-linked package (not
an opaque `node_modules` dependency), Vite's dev server resolves through
the symlink to the real monorepo path and applies its own dev-mode HMR
client injection to every `new Worker(new URL(...), {type:"module"})` it
finds there - including the kernel/process workers. That injected
client's own `console.log('[vite] connected.')` call, once it fires
(after `boot()` has already replaced `console`), gets captured into the
SAME buffer as real guest process stdout - confirmed live: a freshly
spawned process's captured output started with `"[vite]
connected.\n"` before the real command's own output, every time, in dev
mode only.

**Attempted fix made things categorically worse.** Adding `resolve:
{preserveSymlinks: true}` to `examples/playground/vite.config.ts` does
stop Vite from injecting into `@dwc/core`'s worker files - but it does so
by making Vite treat `@dwc/core` as an ordinary `node_modules` dependency,
which puts it through Vite's `optimizeDeps` esbuild pre-bundling by
default. Pre-bundling breaks `new Worker(new URL("workers/kernel/
worker.js", import.meta.url))`'s relative-URL resolution entirely -
confirmed live, repeatedly (`@dwc/core` resolving to `/node_modules/.vite/
deps/@dwc_core.js?v=...`), every single boot failing with `DWCError:
Kernel worker did not respond within 10000ms` / `FSError: Kernel worker
did not respond within 10000ms`. **Reverted immediately**, `.vite`
dep-cache cleared, dev server restarted, confirmed booting cleanly again
(`npm loaded result: 10.9.2 1935`, zero timeout errors, two clean reloads
in a row).

**Decision: leave the original cosmetic leak alone.** The safer
alternative (confine the guest console shim to the module-wrapper's own
closure via a parameter, instead of a global `self.console`
reassignment) would fix the root cause without touching Vite config at
all, but is a more invasive change to `worker.ts`'s core
module-execution mechanism - given how badly the config-level attempt
backfired, explicitly chose not to chase this further for a dev-only,
harmless display issue. Still open if someone wants to pick it up later.

### The real bug hunt: "create-vite: command not found" - three tries to root-cause, verified wrong twice before finding it

Long-running real-world test in `main.ts`: `npm.install()` → `npm create
vite@latest my-vite-app -- --template vanilla` → `npm install` (inside
the scaffold) → `npm run dev`. The `npm create` step kept failing:

```
npm warn exec The following package was not found and will be installed: create-vite@9.2.1
create-vite: command not found
npm error code 127
```

**Attempt 1 (wrong, but a real fix, kept): `fs.utimes`/`fs.utimesSync`
were permanent no-ops.** A live investigation found `create-vite`'s own
`node_modules/create-vite` directory existed but was completely empty,
and separately reproduced `npm error code ECOMPROMISED` in an isolated
repro - real npm's own lock implementation (`libnpmexec/lib/
with-lock.js`, the same algorithm real `proper-lockfile` uses, not that
package itself - it isn't even in npm 12.0.2's own tree) periodically
bumps a lock file's mtime via `fs.utimes()` to prove it's still held,
then re-stats to confirm the bump took effect. A no-op `utimes()` makes
that verification always fail. Fixed for real: a new `FsOp.UTIMES`
kernel operation end-to-end - `kernel/fs/VirtualFileSystem.ts` (new
`utimes(path, mtimeMs)` mutator, follows symlinks like `chmod`, `Stat`
already tracked `mtimeMs` per node so this was a small addition, not a
new timestamp model), `kernel/fs/syncWireFormat.ts` (new `UTIMES = 15`
op, request/response encode/decode), `kernel/fs/syncServer.ts`
(dispatch), `runtime/builtins/fs.ts` (`utimesSync`/real `utimes`/
`futimes`, plus a `toMtimeMs()` helper for real Node's own genuinely
surprising rule that a plain number here means SECONDS since epoch, not
milliseconds - only a `Date` uses real `getTime()` ms). Real, tested
(new cases in `fs.test.ts`, `syncWireFormat.test.ts`), fully verified via
unit tests and typecheck. **Did not fix the actual symptom** - re-tested
live, byte-identical failure.

**Attempt 2 (wrong again, but also a real fix, kept): `fs.promises.utimes`
didn't exist at all.** A second live investigation (constructing a real
sandbox instance and calling into it directly) found `with-lock.js`
actually does `require('node:fs/promises')` and calls the PROMISE form,
not the callback form attempt 1 fixed - reproduced verbatim: `TypeError:
fs.utimes is not a function`. Fixed: added `utimes` to
`createFsPromisesBuiltin` (wired to the now-real `utimesSync`), new test
in `fs.test.ts`. **Also did not fix the actual symptom** - re-verified
live, byte-identical failure again, confirmed skeptically (fetched the
served worker bundle fresh, confirmed the new code was actually in it).

**The real cause, found by refusing to trust either "fix" and getting a
direct diagnostic to the actual failure point:** the browser extension's
console capture can't see kernel-Worker-context `console.log` calls at
all (confirmed - a diagnostic `console.log` placed directly in
`resolveEntryPoint()` never appeared, even after rebuilding and
reloading), so the diagnostic had to write its findings to a VFS file
(`/diag.json`) instead, read back via `dwc.fs.readFile()`. That surfaced
it immediately: `{"pathVar": "", "envKeys": [...no PATH or Path key at
all...]}`. Root cause: `packages/core/src/workers/kernel/
processClient.ts`'s `runProgramViaShell()` - the function behind
`dwc.shell.exec()` - spawned its process with `env: {}`, completely
empty. Real npm's own `@npmcli/run-script`'s `setPATH()` (used to build
the env for whatever `sh -c <cmd>` it spawns, including `npm create`'s
own internal run of the just-fetched binary) only ever **extends** an
existing PATH-shaped env key - it never creates one from scratch (its
own mutation loop is `for (const key of Object.keys(env)) if
(/^path$/i.test(key)) env[key] = pathVal` - a no-op if no such key
exists yet). With no PATH ever seeded, every descendant spawn - no
matter how correctly `create-vite` had already been fetched and
bin-linked, which it always was, the whole time - permanently had
nothing to search. Fixed: one line, `env: {}` → `env: { PATH: "/bin" }`,
matching the exact convention `apis/Process.ts`'s `dwc.process.spawn()`
already used. New regression test in `processClient.test.ts` asserting
the `"boot"` payload now carries `env: { PATH: "/bin" }`.

**Verified live, for real this time, skeptically: 3/3 consecutive runs**
succeed identically, ending with `create-vite`'s own genuine success
banner (`◇ Scaffolding project in /my-vite-app... └ Done. Now run: cd
my-vite-app / npm install / npm run dev`). All three fixes (utimes ×2 +
the PATH default) are real, independently-valid gaps and all three are
kept; only the third was ever the actual blocker for this symptom - a
concrete reminder that a fix passing every test it has doesn't mean it's
the fix for the bug someone is actually chasing.

Two smaller, unrelated gaps hit and fixed along the way during this same
investigation: `fs.rmdirSync` (missing entirely - added, delegates to
the same `FsOp.RM` the existing async `rmdir`/`rmSync` already use,
non-recursive, matching real Node's own `rmdirSync` semantics), and
`diagnostics_channel` (a complete stub already existed in `runtime/node/
lib/diagnostics_channel.js` and was already used internally by `net.js`,
but was never added to `runtime/builtins/index.ts`'s `BUILTIN_NAMES`
allowlist, so guest code - here, `lru-cache`'s minified build, deep in
npm's own dependency tree - couldn't `require()` it directly).

### `dwc.shell.spawn()` - a new, genuinely streaming counterpart to `dwc.shell.exec()`

The actual feature request this all came out of: `dwc.shell.exec()` is
fully buffered - nothing comes back until the whole line finishes, which
for something like a real `npm install` (network-bound, can take minutes
depending on what's being fetched) is indistinguishable from a hang.
The mechanism to stream a shell line's output already existed
internally - `runShellLineStreamed()` in `processClient.ts`, built
earlier for guest-code-initiated `child_process.spawn('sh', ['-c',
...])` (the `cp-exec` relay) - it just had never been exposed to the
host page. This session wired it through:

- `processClient.ts`: new `ShellSpawnPayload`/`ShellKillPayload` types,
  `spawnShell()`/`killShell()` on `ProcessClient`. A `shellId` (not a
  `processId` - a `&&`-chained line can run through several different
  process workers over its lifetime) is minted via `crypto.randomUUID()`
  and tracked in a small `shellWorkers` map (`shellId → Worker | null`),
  updated live via `runShellLineStreamed`'s existing `onWorkerCreated`
  hook, purely so `killShell()` has something to terminate - whichever
  command is CURRENTLY running in the chain. Reuses
  `runProgramViaShell()`'s own `{PATH: "/bin"}` default env.
- `workers/kernel/worker.ts`: new `SHELL_SPAWN`/`SHELL_KILL` router
  entries, same pattern as `PROCESS_SPAWN`/`PROCESS_KILL`.
- `apis/Shell.ts`: new `ShellHandle` (`{stdout, stderr, exit, kill()}`,
  deliberately no `stdin` - no traced need yet, and unlike a single
  `dwc.process.spawn()`'d process, a shell line's identity isn't tied to
  one single process to write to) and `spawn(line, options)`, built the
  same way `createProcessAPI`'s own `spawn()` already is - subscribe to
  `shell:stdout`/`shell:stderr`/`shell:exit` events scoped by `shellId`,
  build real `ReadableStream`s, resolve `exit` from the terminal event.
  `dwc.ts` updated to pass `on` into `createShellAPI` (previously only
  took `request`, since `exec()` alone never needed event subscription).
- Tests: new `apis/Shell.test.ts` (5 cases - exec's own existing
  contract, spawn's stdout/stderr streaming scoped correctly to its own
  shellId, exit code resolution, `kill()`), 3 new cases in
  `processClient.test.ts` (streaming relay AS PRODUCED not buffered,
  `killShell()` terminating the live worker and posting a 143 exit,
  `killShell()` on an unknown id being a silent no-op).
- Docs: new "spawn() — streaming progress" section on the `Shell` docs
  page.

**Verified live, genuinely useful in practice, not just passing tests:**
wired into `main.ts` for the real `npm install`/`npm run dev` steps
(`pipeToConsole()`, a small helper piping each stream's chunks to
`console.log` with a label). Two real, honest confirmations this
actually does what it's for, not just what its own tests assert:
1. A real `npm install` for the scaffolded vite project took genuinely
   ~2 minutes (`added 13 packages in 2m`) with zero output the whole
   time except one leaked `"[vite] connected."` line (see above) - it
   really was just slow, not stuck, and the new streaming showed that
   distinction live instead of leaving it ambiguous the way
   `dwc.shell.exec()` would have.
2. Hours later (machine had gone idle/asleep in between), a retry hit a
   **real, transient network failure** -
   `npm error request to https://registry.npmjs.org/postcss failed:
   fetch failed` - and `dwc.shell.spawn()` surfaced it immediately, live,
   with the real exit code (`1`), rather than it being invisible until
   the whole buffered command eventually gave up. Confirmed the failure
   itself was environmental, not a code bug (`curl` to both
   `registry.npmjs.org` and the local dev server succeeded moments
   later).

### Two more real, smaller findings from the same session, worth a future look

- **`payload.cwd` is never normalized to an absolute path anywhere in
  the spawn chain.** `workers/process/worker.ts:537`'s guest
  `process.cwd()` returns whatever raw string was given
  (`cwd: () => payload.cwd`) - a caller passing a relative path (e.g.
  `dwc.shell.exec("npm install", {cwd: "./my-vite-app"})`, an easy
  mistake to make) makes the guest's own `process.cwd()` violate real
  Node's invariant that it's always absolute, which could plausibly
  confuse real npm's own directory-walking/path-joining logic in subtle
  ways. Not fixed this session (worked around in `main.ts` by using an
  absolute `/my-vite-app` instead) - the right fix is normalizing `cwd`
  (resolve against `/` if relative) at the host-facing boundary in
  `apis/Shell.ts`/`apis/Process.ts`, reusing the same resolution
  `shell/resolvePath.ts`'s `cd` handling already does internally.
- **Still unconfirmed end-to-end: does `main.ts`'s new `"listen"`-event
  wait actually let `dwc.preview.enable()`/the iframe navigation succeed
  for a shell-spawned dev server?** `main.ts` was updated to `await`
  `dwc.addEventListener("listen", ...)` before touching preview (the
  original bug reported this session - `dwc preview relay error:
  nothing is listening on port 5173` - was a plain race: the iframe was
  being pointed at the server before Vite had finished booting, which
  can take 15-20+s for a real cold start). The underlying `"listen"`
  event mechanism is the same one `dwc.process.spawn()` already relies
  on and `spawnShell()`'s own `onEvent` handler explicitly forwards it
  the same way `spawn()`'s does - structurally there's no reason it
  wouldn't fire for a shell-spawned server too, but this was never
  actually confirmed live: the browser extension's console-message
  tracking became unreliable right at this point (silently stopped
  picking up new messages for an extended stretch, unrelated to
  anything in this project's own code) and the check was handed off
  mid-verification. **Pick this up first next session** - reload,
  wait for the real flow to complete (accounts for the genuinely slow
  `npm install`), and confirm whether the iframe actually renders the
  scaffolded page's real content, the way `dwc.preview.fetch()` was
  confirmed to do for a `dwc.process.spawn()`-based server back in
  Phase 3.

Per standing preference, commit messages for this project should not
include `Co-Authored-By`/session-link footers.
